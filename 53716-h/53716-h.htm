<p class="par first">After an interval of about five years, the second
volume of Mr. Alexander Rogers&rsquo; translation of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s Memoirs has been published by the Royal
Asiatic Society. It is a smaller work than the first volume, for it
only extends over six years of the reign, as against the twelve years
of its predecessor. Even then it does not include the whole of the
reign, for that lasted twenty-two years. The two volumes, however,
contain all that Jah&#257;ng&#299;r wrote or supervised. It will be
found, I think, that the present volume is fully as interesting as its
predecessor. The accounts of the Zodiacal coinage (pp. 6 and 7), and of
the comet, or new star (p. 48), the notice of the Plague in Agra (pp.
65&ndash;67), and the elaborate description of Kashm&#299;r, under the
chronicle of the 15th year, are valuable, and a word should be said for
the pretty story of the King and the Gardener&rsquo;s daughter (p. 50),
and for the allusions to painters and pictures.</p>
<p class="par">If B&#257;bur, who was the founder of the Moghul Empire
in India, was the C&aelig;sar of the East, and if the many-sided Akbar
was an epitome of all the great Emperors, including Augustus, Trajan,
Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius, Julian, and Justinian. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was
certainly of the type of the Emperor Claudius, and so bore a close
resemblance to our James I. All three were weak men, and under the
influence of their favourites, and all three were literary, and at
least two of them were fond of dabbling in theology. All three were in
their wrong places as rulers. Had James I. (and VI. of Scotland) been,
as he half wished, the Keeper of the Bodleian, and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
been head of a Natural History Museum, they would have been better and
happier men. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s best <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e166" href="#xd24e166" name=
"xd24e166">vi</a>]</span>points were his love of nature and powers of
observation, and his desire to do justice. Unfortunately, the last of
these merits was vitiated by a propensity for excessive and recondite
punishments. Like his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, he
was addicted to drugs and alcohol, and he shortened his life in this
way. He made no addition to the imperial territories, but, on the
contrary, diminished them by losing Qandahar to the Persians. But
possibly his peaceful temper, or his laziness, was an advantage, for it
saved much bloodshed. His greatest fault as a king was his subservience
to his wife, N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n, and the consequent quarrel with his
son, Shah Jahan, who was the ablest and best of his male children. The
last years of his reign were especially melancholy, for he suffered
from asthma and other diseases; and he had to endure the ignominy of
being for a while a captive to one of his own
servants&mdash;Mah&#257;bat K&#863;h&#257;n. He died on the borders of
Kashmir, when on his way to Lahore, in October, 1627, in the
fifty-ninth year of his age, and was buried at Sh&#257;hdara, near
Lahore, where his widow, N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n, and her brother are also
interred. At the time of his death his son Shah Jahan was at Junair in
the Deccan, and there the news was conveyed in a wonderfully short time
by a Hindu courier. Jah&#257;ng&#299;r was succeeded by Shah Jahan, who
lost no time in getting rid of his relatives, for, like the Turk, he
bore no kinsman near the throne. Indeed, he is strongly suspected of
having killed his elder brother, K&#863;husrau, several years
before.</p>

<p class="par first">On the eve of Wednesday, the 23rd
Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-awwal, 1027 (March 10, 1618), after the lapse of
fourteen and a half <i>ghar&#299;s</i>, the entrance of the
Sun&mdash;that is, H.M. the Great Light&mdash;the Benefactor of the
Universe, into the constellation of the Ram, took place. Twelve years
had now passed from the august Accession of this suppliant at the
throne of God, in prosperity, and the New Year began in joy and
thanksgiving. On Thursday, 2 Farward&#299;n, Divine month, the festival
of my Lunar weighment took place, and the fifty-first<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e253src" href="#xd24e253" name="xd24e253src">1</a> year of the
age of this suppliant at God&rsquo;s throne began with rejoicings. I
trust that my life will be spent in the doing of God&rsquo;s Will, and
that not a breath of it will pass without remembering Him. After the
weighment had been finished, a fresh feast of joy was arranged, and my
domestic servants celebrated the day with brimming cups.</p>
<p class="par">On this day &#256;&#7779;af K.
(N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s brother), who held the rank of 5,000 with
3,000 horse, was favoured by the grant of 4,000 two-horsed and
three-horsed troopers, and S&#804;&#257;bit K. was raised to the office
of Examiner of Petitions. I bestowed the post of the Artillery on
Mu&#703;tamid K. A Kachh (Cutch) horse had been brought as an offering
by the son of Dil&#257;war K. No horse so good as this had come into my
establishment till I encamped in Gujarat, and as M. Rustam showed a
great liking for it, I presented it to him. On the J&#257;m were
conferred four rings&mdash;viz., diamond, ruby, emerald, and
sapphire<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>&mdash;and two hawks. I also gave four
rings&mdash;viz., ruby, cat&rsquo;s-eye, emerald, and sapphire&mdash;to
Raja Lachm&#299; Nar&#257;yan (of K&#363;ch Bih&#257;r). Muruwwat K.
had sent three elephants from Bengal, and two of them were included in
my private stud. On the eve of Friday I ordered lamps to be placed
round the tank, and this had a very good appearance. On Sunday
H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Raf&#299;q came from &#703;Ir&#257;q, and had the
good fortune to kiss the threshold, and laid before me a letter which
my brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s had sent with him. The
aforesaid person is a slave of M&#299;r Muh&#803;ammad Am&#299;n K.,
the caravan leader, and the M&#299;r had brought him up from his
childhood. In truth, he is an excellent servant. He frequently visited
&#703;Ir&#257;q, and became intimate with my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s. This time he had brought tipch&#257;q<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e263src" href="#xd24e263" name="xd24e263src">2</a>
horses and fine cloth-stuffs, such that of the horses some were put
into the private stables. As he is a skilful slave, and a servant
worthy of favour, I honoured him with the title of
<i>Maliku-t-tujj&#257;r</i> (King of Merchants). On Monday I gave Raja
Lachm&#299; Nar&#257;yan a special sword, a jewelled rosary, and four
pearls for ear-rings. On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday) I
increased by 500 horse the man&#7779;ab of 5,000 personal and 1,000
horse held by M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam; I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. was promoted
to a man&#7779;ab of 4,000 and 1,000 horse; Sarfar&#257;z K. was
promoted to a man&#7779;ab of 2,500 and 1,400 horse; Mu&#703;tamid K.
to the rank of 1,000 with 350 horse. On An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299;
Singh-dalan and Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K., horses worth 100
<i>muhars</i> were conferred. As the guarding and administration of the
Punjab had been entrusted to I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, I, at his
request, promoted to the government (h&#803;uk&#363;mat) of the said
&#7778;ubah, M&#299;r Q&#257;sim, the Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; of the
Ah&#803;ad&#299;s, who is related to him, and bestowed on him a
man&#7779;ab of 1,000 personal with 400 horse and the title of
Q&#257;sim K. Before this I had given Raja Lachm&#299; Nar&#257;yan an
&#703;Ir&#257;q horse. On this day I conferred on him an elephant and a
Turk&#299; horse, and gave him leave to go to Bengal. The J&#257;m was
dismissed to his native country with a present of a jewelled
waist-sword, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>a jewelled rosary, two horses, one from
&#703;Ir&#257;q and the other a Turk&#299;, and a dress of honour.
&#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, brother&rsquo;s son of the deceased
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e281src"
href="#xd24e281" name="xd24e281src">3</a> was promoted to a
man&#7779;ab of 1,000 with 300 horse, and allowed to go to Bengal, and
a horse was conferred on him. On this date M&#299;r Jumla<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e284src" href="#xd24e284" name="xd24e284src">4</a>
came from Persia, and had the good fortune to pay his respects. The
aforesaid is one of the respectable Sayyids of Isfahan and his family
have always been held in honour in Persia, and now his brother&rsquo;s
son, M&#299;r Riz&#803;&#257;, is in the service of my brother,
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, and has the rank of &#7778;adr, and
the Shah has married him to his own daughter. M&#299;r Jumla had left
Persia fourteen years before this, and gone to Golconda to
Muh&#803;ammad Qul&#299; Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. His name is Muh&#803;ammad
Am&#299;n. Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk gave him the title of M&#299;r Jumla. For
ten years he had been his <i>Mud&#257;r &#703;Alaihi</i> (Centre of
Affairs) and his <i>&#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib S&#257;m&#257;n</i>
(factotum). After Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk died, and the rule came to his
brother&rsquo;s son, the latter did not treat the M&#299;r properly,
and so he took leave and hastened to his native country. The Shah, on
account of his connection with M&#299;r Riz&#803;&#257;, and the
respect which he had for men<a class="noteref" id="xd24e293src" href=
"#xd24e293" name="xd24e293src">5</a> of merit, showed much
consideration for and kindness to him. He (the M&#299;r) also presented
fitting offerings, and passed three or four years in Persia, and
amassed properties (estates?).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e297src" href=
"#xd24e297" name="xd24e297src">6</a> As he several times represented
that he wished to enter the service of this Court, I sent a farm&#257;n
and invited him. Immediately the farm&#257;n arrived he severed his
connections there, and set the face of loyalty towards this Court. This
day he attained the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4"
name="pb4">4</a>]</span>honour of kissing the carpet, and produced as
offering twelve horses, nine <i>tuq&#363;z</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e304src" href="#xd24e304" name="xd24e304src">7</a> of silk cloths,
and two rings. As he had come with devotion and sincerity, I conferred
favours and kindness on him, and presented him with 20,000 <i>darbs</i>
(Rs. 10,000) for his expenses and a dress of honour. On the same day I
gave the post of Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; of the Ah&#803;ad&#299;s to
&#703;In&#257;yat K. in place of Q&#257;sim K. I honoured
K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;&#256;qil, who is one of the old servants, with
the title of &#703;&#256;qil K., and presented him with a horse. On
Friday, Dil&#257;war K., coming from the Deccan, had the good fortune
to kiss the threshold, and presented an offering of 100 <i>muhars</i>
and Rs. 1,000. B&#257;qir K., Faujd&#257;r of Multan, was promoted to a
man&#7779;ab of 800 personal and 300 horse. Tij&#257;rat K. and
B&#257;h&#363;&#702;&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e314src" href=
"#xd24e314" name="xd24e314src">8</a> Zamindar of Multan, were honoured
with the gift of elephants. On Saturday, the 11th, marching from
Doh&#803;ad with the intention of hunting elephants, I pitched at the
village of Kara B&#257;ra (Garbara ?). On Sunday, the 12th, the village
of Saj&#257;ra (Sajwara ?) became the place of alighting. It is 8
<i>koss</i> from this place to Doh&#803;ad, and 1&frac12; <i>koss</i>
to the hunting-ground. On the morning of Monday, the 13th, I went to
hunt elephants with a body of my private servants. As the grazing-place
of the elephants is in a hilly country, with elevations and
depressions, a passage is obtained with difficulty by one on foot.
Before this, a large body of horse and foot had surrounded the jungle
after the manner of a <i>qamurg&#863;ha</i>, and outside the jungle, on
a tree, they had prepared a wooden platform for me. On all sides of
this they had arranged seats on other trees for the Amirs. They had got
ready 200 male elephants with strong nooses, and many female elephants.
On each elephant there were seated two elephant-drivers of the tribe of
<i>Jarga</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e329src" href="#xd24e329" name=
"xd24e329src">9</a> whose special employment <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>is the
hunting of elephants, and it had been arranged that they should bring
the wild elephants from the jungle into my presence, that I might
witness the hunt. It happened that at the time when the men from all
sides entered the jungle, in consequence of the thickness of the forest
and the heights and hollows, the chain was broken, and the order of the
<i>qamurg&#863;ha</i> did not remain perfect. The wild elephants in
bewilderment turned in every direction, but twelve male and female came
to this side (where J. was). As the fear was that they might escape,
they drove in the tame elephants and tied them (the wild elephants) up
wherever they found them. Although many elephants were not caught, at
least two excellent ones were captured, very handsome in shape, of good
breed, and perfect marks. As there is a hill in the jungle in which the
elephants were, called R&#257;kas (R&#257;kshas) Pah&#257;r,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e338src" href="#xd24e338" name="xd24e338src">10</a>
or demon hill, I called these two elephants R&#257;van Sar and
P&#257;van Sar, these being the names of two demons. On Tuesday, the
14th, and Kam-s&#863;hamba (Wednesday), the 15th, I halted.</p>
<p class="par">On the eve of Thursday, the 16th, I marched, and halted
at the stage of Kara B&#257;ra. H&#803;ak&#299;m Beg,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e343src" href="#xd24e343" name="xd24e343src">11</a> who is one
of the household of the Court, was honoured with the title of
H&#803;ak&#299;m K., and a sum of Rs. 3,000 was given to Sangr&#257;m,
a Zamindar of the hill country of the Panjab. As the heat was very
great, and marching by day was to be avoided, I marched by night. On
Saturday, the 18th, a halt was made in the parganah of Doh&#803;ad. On
Sunday, the 19th, the sun that bestows favour on the world attained the
highest point in the constellation of Aries. On this day a great
entertainment was held, and I sat on the throne. I promoted
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K., who held a man&#7779;ab of 5,000, with
the favour of 2,000 horse, of two and three horses. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the Chief Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, was given a
mansab, original and increased, of 4,000 with 2,000 horse. As Ahmad Beg
K., of Kabul, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>had obtained the governorship of Kashmir, had
promised that he would conquer in the space of two years Tibet and
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, and the promised time had elapsed, and he had not
fulfilled this service, I removed him, and promoted Dil&#257;war K.
K&#257;kar to the Government of Kashmir. I gave him a dress of honour
and an elephant, and sent him off. He also made a promise in writing
that in the course of two years he would conquer Tibet and
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r. Bad&#299;&#702;u-z-Zam&#257;n, s.
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h M. came from the jagir he held in
Sult&#804;&#257;np&#363;r, and had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold. Having at this time honoured Q&#257;sim K. with a jewelled
dagger and an elephant, I dismissed him to the Government of the
Punjab.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Tuesday, the 21st, I marched from the
stage mentioned, and turned the reins of the army of prosperity towards
Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d. As in consequence of the great heat and the
corruption of the air I would have had to undergo much hardship, and
would have had to traverse a long distance before reaching Agra, it
occurred to me not to proceed at this hot season to the capital. As I
heard much praise of the rainy season in Gujarat, and there was no
report about the evil reputation of Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d (see
<i>infra</i> for account of epidemic there), I finally conceived the
idea of remaining there. Inasmuch as the protection and guardianship of
God (to Him be praise) was in all places and at all times extended to
this suppliant, just at this crisis news arrived that signs of the
plague (<i>wab&#257;</i>) had shown themselves again at Agra, and many
people were dying, my intention of not going to Agra, which had thrown
its rays on my mind through Divine inspiration, was confirmed. The
entertainment of Thursday, the 23rd, was held at the station of
Jalod.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e356src" href="#xd24e356" name=
"xd24e356src">12</a></p>
<p class="par">Previously to this, the rule of coinage was that on one
face of the metal they stamped my name, and on the reverse the name of
the place, and the month and year of the reign. At this time it entered
my mind that in place of the month they should substitute the figure of
the constellation which belonged to that month; for instance, in the
month of Farward&#299;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7"
name="pb7">7</a>]</span>the figure of a ram, and in
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht the figure of a bull. Similarly, in each month
that a coin was struck, the figure of the constellation was to be on
one face, as if the sun were emerging from it. This usage is my own,
and has never been practised until now.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e363src" href="#xd24e363" name="xd24e363src">13</a></p>
<p class="par">On this day I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. was promoted to the
dignity of a standard, and a standard was also conferred on Muruwwat
K., who was attached to Bengal. On the night of Monday,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e368src" href="#xd24e368" name="xd24e368src">14</a>
the 27th, the camp was pitched in the village of Badrw&#257;la, in the
parganah of Sahra.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e371src" href="#xd24e371"
name="xd24e371src">15</a> At this stage was heard the voice of the koel
(<i>koyal</i>). The koel is a bird of the crow tribe, but smaller. The
crow&rsquo;s eyes are black, and those of the koel red. The female has
white spots, but the male is all black. The male has a very pleasant
voice, quite unlike that of the female. It is in reality the
nightingale of India. Just as the nightingale is agitated and noisy in
the spring, so is the cry of the koel at the approach of the rainy
season, which is the spring of Hindustan. Its cry is exceedingly
pleasant and penetrating, and the bird begins its exhilaration
(<i>mast&#299;</i>) when the mangoes ripen. It frequently sits on the
mango-trees, and is delighted with the colour and scent of the mango. A
strange thing about the koel is that it does not bring up its young
from the egg, but, finding the nest of the crow unguarded at the time
of laying, it breaks the crow&rsquo;s eggs with its beak, throws them
out, and lays its own in the place of them, and flies off. The crow,
thinking the eggs its own, hatches the young and brings them up. I have
myself seen this strange affair at Allahabad.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of <i>Kams&#863;hamba</i> (Wednesday), the
29th, the camp was on the bank of the M&#257;h&#299;, and the
entertainment of <i>Mub&#257;raks&#863;hamba</i> was held there. Two
springs appeared on the bank of the M&#257;h&#299;, that had very clear
water, so much so that if a poppy-seed fell into them the whole of it
was visible. All that day I passed with the ladies. As it was a
pleasant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>place to walk about in, I ordered them to build a
raised seat round each of the springs. On Friday I fished in the
M&#257;h&#299;, and large fish with scales fell into the net. I first
told my son, S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, to try his sword on them.
After this I ordered the Am&#299;rs to strike them with the swords they
had in their belts. My son&rsquo;s sword cut better than all of theirs.
These fish were divided among the servants who were present. On the eve
of Saturday, the 1st of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, marching from the
above-mentioned stage, I ordered<a class="noteref" id="xd24e390src"
href="#xd24e390" name="xd24e390src">16</a> the mace-bearers
(<i>yas&#257;wul&#257;n</i>) and <i>taw&#257;chiy&#257;n</i> to collect
the widows and poor people from the villages on the road and near it,
and bring them before me, so that I might bestow charity on them with
my own hand, which would be an occupation, and the helpless ones might
also find grace. What better occupation could there be than this? On
Monday, the 3rd, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K. &#703;Arab, and Himmat K.,
and other servants who belonged to the Deccan and Gujarat, had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold. The holy men and the possessors of
blessing (faq&#299;rs, etc.) who lived at Ahmadabad paid their respects
to me. On Tuesday, the 4th, the bank of the river at
Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d became the alighting place. Rustam K.,
whom my son, S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, had left in the Government of
Gujarat, was honoured by paying his respects. The entertainment of
Thursday, the 6th, was held on the bank of the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank.
N&#257;hir K., according to order, came from the Deccan and raised the
head of honour with the good fortune of prostrating himself before
me.</p>
<p class="par">A diamond ring was presented to my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, as part of the offering of
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. It was of the value of 1,000 muhars, and on it
there appeared three letters of equal size and of good form, such that
they made the word Lillahi (for God). This diamond had been sent, as it
was reckoned one of the marvels of the world. In fact, veins and
scratches are flaws in precious stones, but it was generally thought
that the marks on this one were fabricated. Moreover, the diamond did
not come from any celebrated mine. As my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, wished that it should be sent to my
brother, S&#863;h&#257;h <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9"
name="pb9">9</a>]</span>&#703;Abb&#257;s, as a souvenir of the conquest
of the Deccan it was sent to the Shah along with other gifts.<a class=

<p class="par">On this day I presented Brikha R&#257;y
<i>b&#257;d-far&#363;s&#863;h</i> (panegyrist) with Rs. 1,000. He is a
Gujar&#257;t&#299; by origin, and is fully versed in the chronicles and
circumstances of that country. His name was
B&#363;n&#7789;&#257;&mdash;that is, a sapling (<i>nih&#257;l</i>). It
seemed to me that it was anomalous to call an old man
B&#363;n&#7789;&#257;, especially now that he had become verdant
(<i>sar-sabz</i>) and fruit-bearing through the irrigation
(<i>sah&#803;&#257;b</i>, literally, cloud, or mirage) of our kindness.
I therefore ordered that henceforth he should be called Brikha
R&#257;y. Brikha means &ldquo;tree&rdquo; in Hind&#299;. On Friday, the
7th of the aforesaid month, corresponding with the 1st
Jum&#257;da-l-awwal, at a chosen propitious hour, I entered the city of
Ahmadabad with all enjoyment. At the time of mounting, my son of
prosperous fortune, S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, had brought 20,000
<i>charan</i>, or Rs. 5,000, for the <i>nis&#804;&#257;r</i>
(scattering), and I scattered them as I hastened to the palace. When I
alighted there he laid before me by way of an offering a jewelled
<i>&#7789;urra</i> (aigrette) of the value of Rs. 25,000, and those of
his officers whom he had left in this Subah also presented offerings.
They altogether amounted to nearly Rs. 40,000. As it was represented to
me that K&#863;hw&#257;ja Beg M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;afaw&#299; had
reached the neighbourhood of the forgiveness of God&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
had died&mdash;at Ah&#803;madnagar, I promoted to a mansab of 2,000
personal and horse, original and increased, K&#863;hanjar K., whom he
had adopted as his son, and, indeed, held dearer than a son of his
loins, and who was in truth, an intelligent, ambitious youth, and a
servant worthy of patronage, and entrusted him with the charge of the
fort of Ahmadnagar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"

<p class="par">In these days, in consequence of the great heat and the
corruption of the air, sickness had broken out among the people, and of
those in the city and the camp there were few who for two or three days
had not been ill. Inflammatory fever or pains in the limbs attacked
them, and in the course of two or three days they became exceedingly
ill&mdash;so much so that even after recovery they remained for a long
time weak and languid. They mostly at last recovered, so that but few
were in danger of their lives. I heard from old men who resided in this
country that thirty years before this the same kind of fever prevailed,
and passed away happily. Anyhow, there appeared some deterioration in
the climate of Gujarat, and I much regretted having come here. I trust
that the great and glorious God, in His mercy and grace, will lift up
this burden, which is a source of uneasiness to my mind, from off the
people. On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday), the 13th,
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, s. M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal
and horse, and presented with a standard, and appointed faujd&#257;r of
Sark&#257;r Pa&#7789;an. Sayyid Niz&#803;&#257;m, faujd&#257;r of
Sark&#257;r Lucknow, was raised to the man&#7779;ab of 1,000 personal
and 700 horse. The man&#7779;ab of &#703;Al&#299; Qul&#299; Darman, who
was attached to the province of Qandahar, at the request of
Bah&#257;dur K., the governor thereof, was ordered to be 1,000 personal
and 700 horse. Sayyid Hizbar K. B&#257;rha was dignified with the
man&#7779;ab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. I promoted Zabardast K.
to the rank of 800 personal and 350 horse. On this day Q&#257;sim
K&#863;hw&#257;ja of Dihb&#299;d<a class="noteref" id="xd24e462src"
href="#xd24e462" name="xd24e462src">18</a> had sent from
M&#257;-war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr (Transoxiana) by the hand of one of his
tribesmen by way of supplication five <i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i>
(white) falcons. One died on the road, and four arrived at Ujjain in
safety. I ordered them to hand over the sum of Rs. 5,000 to someone
among them, that he might purchase and take with him whatever things
would be agreeable to the K&#863;hw&#257;ja, and gave a reward of Rs.
1,000 to himself. At this time K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, who had
been sent as ambassador to the ruler of Persia, sent an
<i>&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299;</i> falcon (bird from the nest), which

but after they have been flown the difference is clear. On Thursday,
the 20th, M&#299;r Ab&#363;-&#7779;-&#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, a relation
(? son-in-law) of the deceased M&#299;rz&#257; Y&#363;suf K., came from
the Deccan by order, and enjoyed the good fortune of kissing the
threshold. He presented as an offering 100 <i>muhars</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e497src" href="#xd24e497" name="xd24e497src">21</a>
and a jewelled plume (<i>kalg&#299;</i>). M&#299;rz&#257; Y&#363;suf
K.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e504src" href="#xd24e504" name=
"xd24e504src">22</a> was one of the Riz&#803;aw&#299; Sayyids of
Mashhad, and his family was always held in great honour in Khurasan,
and just now my brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s has given his
daughter in marriage to the younger brother of the aforesaid
Ab&#363;-&#7779;-&#7778;&#257;lih&#803;. His father, M&#299;rz&#257;
Atag&#863;h,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e507src" href="#xd24e507" name=
"xd24e507src">23</a> was the head of the attendants of the mausoleum of
Riz&#803;&#257;, the 8th Im&#257;m. M&#299;rz&#257; Y&#363;suf
K&#863;h&#257;n, by means of the patronage of H.M. (Akbar), had risen
to nobility, and attained to the man&#7779;ab of 5,000. Without doubt
he was a good M&#299;r, and held his many servants in good order. A
number of relations gathered round him. He died<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e510src" href="#xd24e510" name="xd24e510src">24</a> in the Deccan.
Although he left many sons, who obtained favours in consideration of
former services, special attention was paid to the development of his
eldest son. In a short time I advanced him to the rank of nobility.
Certainly there is a great difference between him and his father.</p>
<p class="par">On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday), the
27th, I presented H&#803;ak&#299;m Mas&#299;h&#803;u-z-zam&#257;n with
20,000 <i>darbs</i> (8 anna pieces), and to H&#803;ak&#299;m
R&#363;h&#803;u-llah 100 <i>muhars</i> and Rs. 1,000. As he had
thoroughly diagnosed my constitution, he perceived that the climate of
Gujarat was very inimical to it. He said: &ldquo;As soon as you
moderate your habit of taking wine and opium, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>all
these troubles of yours will disappear.&rdquo; Indeed, when I in one
day diminished (the quantity I took of) both of them, there was a great
gain on that first day. On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday),
the 3rd K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, Qizilb&#257;s&#863;h K. was promoted
to the man&#7779;ab, original and increased, of 1,500 personal and
1,200 horse. A report was received from Gajpat K., superintendent of
the elephant stables, and Bal&#363;ch K., chief huntsman
(<i>Qar&#257;wul Beg</i>), that up to this time sixty-nine elephants,
male and female, had been caught. Whatever took place after this would
be reported. I ordered them to beware not to take old or small
elephants; but with this exception they should catch all they saw, male
or female. On Monday, the 14th,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e534src"
href="#xd24e534" name="xd24e534src">25</a> the sum of Rs. 2,000 was
presented for S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam&rsquo;s anniversary, to
Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad, his representative. A special Kachh horse, one
of the good horses of the J&#257;m which had been presented to me, was
given to R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo. I made a present of Rs. 1,000 to
Bal&#363;ch K., the chief huntsman, who is engaged in capturing
elephants. On Tuesday, 15th, I found I had a severe headache, which at
last ended in fever. At night I did not drink my usual number of cups,
and after midnight crop-sickness<a class="noteref" id="xd24e537src"
href="#xd24e537" name="xd24e537src">26</a> was added to my fever, and
till morning I rolled about on my couch. On Wednesday, the 16th, at the
end of the day, the fever diminished, and, after asking the advice of
my doctors, I took my usual number of cups on the third night. Although
they urged me to take some broth of pulse and rice, I could not make up
my mind to do so. Since I arrived at the age of discretion, I never
remember having taken <i>b&#363;g&#863;h&#257;n</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e548src" href="#xd24e548" name="xd24e548src">27</a> broth, and
hope that I may not want it in future. When they brought food for me
this day, I had no inclination for it. In short, for three days and two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>nights I remained fasting. Though I had fever for
a day and a night, and my weakness was such that it appeared as if I
had been confined to bed for a long time, I had no appetite left, and
had no inclination towards food.</p>
<p class="par">I<a class="noteref" id="xd24e561src" href="#xd24e561"
name="xd24e561src">28</a> am amazed to think what pleasure or goodness
the founder of this city could have seen in a spot so devoid of the
favour (of God) as to build a city on it. After him, others, too, have
passed their lives in precious trouble in this dustbin. Its air is
poisonous, and its soil has little water, and is of sand and dust, as
has already<a class="noteref" id="xd24e564src" href="#xd24e564" name=
"xd24e564src">29</a> been described. Its water is very bad and
unpalatable, and the river, which is by the side of the city, is always
dry except in the rainy season. Its wells are mostly salt and bitter,
and the tanks in the neighbourhood of the city have become like
buttermilk from washermen&rsquo;s soap. The upper classes who have some
property have made reservoirs in their houses, which they fill with
rainwater in the rainy season, and they drink that water until the next
year. The evils of water to which the air never penetrates, and which
has no way for the vapour to come out by, are evident. Outside the
city, in place of green grass and flowers, all is an open plain full of
thorn-brakes (<i>zaqq&#363;m</i>), and as for the breeze that blows off
the thorns, its excellence is known:</p>

</div>
<p class="par first">Now, I do not know whether to call it

B&#299;m&#257;rist&#257;n (abode of sickness), or Zaqq&#363;m-z&#257;r
(the thorn-bed), or Jahannam&#257;b&#257;d (the house of Hell), for it
contains all these varieties. If the rainy season had not prevented me,
I would not have delayed one day in this abode of trouble, but, like
Solomon, would have seated myself on the throne of the wind, and
hastened out, and released the people of God from this pain and
trouble. As the men of this city are exceedingly weak-hearted and
wretched, in order to guard against any of the men from the camp
entering their houses with a view to oppress them, or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=

(<i>r&#363;-d&#299;dag&#299;</i>), temporize and not stop such
oppression, I, from the date on which I entered the city,
notwithstanding the heat of the air, every day, after completing the
midday prayer, went and sat in the <i>Jharoka</i>. It was towards the
river, and had no impediment in the shape of gate, or wall, or
watch-men (<i>yas&#257;wul</i>), or <i>chobd&#257;rs</i>
(mace-bearers). For the sake of administering justice, I <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e598" title="Source: sate">sat</span> there for two or
three sidereal hours and listened to the cries for redress, and ordered
punishments on the oppressors according to their faults and crimes.
Even in the time of weakness I have gone every day to the
<i>jharoka</i>, though in great pain and sorrow, according to my fixed
custom, and have looked on ease of body as something unlawful<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e604src" href="#xd24e604" name="xd24e604src">31</a>

there are two advantages&mdash;one, the knowledge of the kingdom; the
other, wakefulness of heart in calling God to mind. God forbid that
this life of a few days should pass in carelessness. As a heavy sleep
is in front, I must reckon as a gain this time of my wakefulness, which
I shall not see again in sleep, and must not be careless of
recollecting God for a single wink. &ldquo;Be wakeful, for a

contracted fever, my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, who is close to my
heart, also contracted it. His attack lasted a long time, and for ten
days he could not come to pay his respects. He came on Thursday, the
24th, and waited on me, and appeared very weak and powerless, so much
so that if anyone had not explained the matter, one might have supposed
he had been ill for a month or more. I am grateful that at last all
ended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=

had come from &#298;r&#257;n&mdash;a summary of what had happened to
him has been already written&mdash;was honoured with the mansab of
1,500 personal and 200 horse. On this day, in consequence of the
weakness I suffered from, I bestowed as alms on deserving people an
elephant, a horse, and varieties of quadrupeds, with a quantity of gold
and silver and other valuable things. Most of my servants also brought
alms according to their means. I told them that if their object was to
parade their loyalty, their proceeding was not acceptable, and if they
were acting from genuine piety there was no need for bringing their
alms into the Presence; they could secretly and personally distribute
them to the poor and needy. On <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i>
(Thursday), the 7th T&#299;r, Divine month, &#7778;&#257;diq K.
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal

1,000 horse, with the title of Riz&#803;aw&#299; K&#863;h&#257;n, and,
being honoured with a standard and an elephant, he took leave for the
Deccan.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was represented to me that the
Commander-in-Chief, the &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q

&#7778;afaw&#299; and M&#299;rz&#257; Mur&#257;d, his son, had also

<p class="par first">Of those who were present at the entertainment who
had the poetic temperament each composed an ode, and presented it. It
became known that the hemistich was from Maul&#257;n&#257;
&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;m&#257;n J&#257;m&#299;. I looked at the whole of

become famous over the world, he has not written anything <span class=

Ah&#803;mad Beg K., governor of Kashmir. His sons, who were of the
house-born ones of the Court, and on whose foreheads the signs of
intelligence and zeal were manifest, obtained suitable mansabs, and
were sent to do duty in the &#7778;uba of Bangas&#863;h and Kabul. His
mansab was that of 2,500; his eldest son obtained that of 3,000
(?),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e665src" href="#xd24e665" name=

adorned with the high qualities of dignity, honour, generosity, and
valour, under whose rule was one of the th&#257;nas of the country of

original and increased, and the title of B&#257;q&#299; K. R&#257;y

<p class="par">At this time the pairing of the <i>s&#257;ras</i>, which
I had never seen before, and is reported never to have been seen by
man, was witnessed by me. The <i>s&#257;ras</i> is a creature of the
crane genus, but somewhat larger.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e676src"
href="#xd24e676" name="xd24e676src">36</a> On the top of the head it
has no feathers, and the skin is drawn over the bones of the head. From
the back of the eye to six finger-breadths of the neck it is red. They
mostly live in pairs on the plains, but are occasionally seen in
flocks. People bring a pair in from the fields, and keep them in their
houses, and they become familiar with men. In fact, there was a pair of
<i>s&#257;ras</i> in my establishment to which I had given the names of
Lail&#257; and Majn&#363;n. One day a eunuch informed me that (the) two
had paired in his presence. I ordered that if they showed an
inclination to pair again they should inform me. At dawn he came and
told me that they were about to pair again. I immediately hastened to
look on. The female having straightened its legs bent down a little:
the male then lifted up one of its feet from the ground and placed it
on her back, and afterwards the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>second foot, and, immediately
seating himself on her back, paired with her. He then came down, and,
stretching out his neck, put his beak to the ground, and walked once
round the female. It is possible they may have an egg and produce a
young one. Many strange tales of the affection of the <i>s&#257;ras</i>
for its mate have been heard. The following case has been recorded
because it is very strange. Qiy&#257;m K., who is one of the
k&#863;h&#257;naz&#257;ds (houseborn ones) of this Court, and is well
acquainted with the arts of hunting and scouting, informed me that one
day he had gone out to hunt, and found a <i>s&#257;ras</i> sitting.
When he approached, it got up and went off. From its manner of walking
he perceived signs of weakness and pain. He went to the place where it
had been sitting, and saw some bones and a handful of feathers on which
it had been sitting. He threw a net round it, and drew himself into a
corner, and it tried to go and sit in the same place. Its foot was
caught in the net, and he went forward and seized it. It appeared
extremely light, and when he looked minutely he saw there were no
feathers on its breast and belly: its flesh and skin had separated, and
there were maggots. Moreover, there was no sign of flesh left on any of
its members: a handful of feathers and bone came into his hand. It was
clear that its mate had died, and that it had sate there from the day
it lost its companion.</p>

<p class="par first">Himmat K., who is one of my best servants, and
whose word is worthy of reliance, told me that in the
Doh&#803;ad<a class="noteref" id="xd24e711src" href="#xd24e711" name=
"xd24e711src">37</a> pargana he had seen a pair of <i>s&#257;ras</i> on
the bank of a tank. One of his gunners shot one of them, and in the
same place cut off its head and stripped<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e717src" href="#xd24e717" name="xd24e717src">38</a> it of its
feathers (?). By chance we halted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18"
href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>two or three days at that place,
and its mate continually walked round it, and uttered cries and
lamentation. &ldquo;My heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ached at its
distress, but there was no remedy for it save regret.&rdquo; By chance,
twenty-five days afterwards, he passed by the same spot, and asked the
inhabitants what had become of that <i>s&#257;ras</i>. They said it
died on the same day, and there were still remains of feathers and
bones on the spot. He went there himself, and saw it was as they said.
There are many tales of this kind among the people, which it would take
too long to tell.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 16th, there came the news of the death
of R&#257;wat S&#863;hankar, who was one of those on duty in
Bih&#257;r. M&#257;n Singh, his eldest son, was raised to the
man&#7779;ab of 2,000 personal and 600 horse: his other sons and
connections were also raised in man&#7779;ab, and were directed to obey
him. On Thursday, the 21st, the elephant B&#257;van,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e729src" href="#xd24e729" name="xd24e729src">39</a> the pick of
my catch, which had been left in the pargana of Doh&#803;ad to be
tamed, was brought to Court. I ordered him to be kept near the jharoka
on the river side, that he might be constantly under my eye. In the
elephant-stables of H.M. Akbar the largest elephant I saw was Durjan
S&#257;l. It was long the premier elephant. Its height was 4 yards
(<i>dara&#703;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e734src" href="#xd24e734"
name="xd24e734src">40</a>), and 3&frac12; quarters of the
<i>Il&#257;h&#299; gaz</i>, which is 8 yards and 3 fingers of the
ordinary <i>gaz</i>. At present, among the elephants of my
establishment, the largest athlete is &#703;&#256;lam-Gajr&#257;j,
which H.M. Akbar himself had caught. It is the chief of my special
elephants. Its height is 4&#8539; yards, or 7 yards and 7
fingers<a class="noteref" id="xd24e752src" href="#xd24e752" name=
"xd24e752src">41</a> of the ordinary yard. The ordinary <i>gaz</i> has
been fixed at 24 fingers&rsquo; breadth of an average-sized man, and
the <i>Il&#257;h&#299; gaz</i> is 40 fingers&rsquo; breadth.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Muz&#804;affar K., who had been promoted to
the Subadarship of Thatta (Sind), had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold. He presented 100 <i>muhars</i> and Rs. 100 as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>naz&#817;r, and the equivalent of Rs. 100,000 in
jewels and jewelled things. At this time news came that God Almighty
had bestowed on my son Parw&#299;z a son<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e772src" href="#xd24e772" name="xd24e772src">42</a> by the
daughter of S&#863;h&#257;h Mur&#257;d, deceased. It is to be hoped
that his coming will be of good omen to this State.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 24th, R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e777src" href="#xd24e777" name="xd24e777src">43</a>
had the good fortune to kiss the threshold: there is not a greater
Zamindar than this in the country of Gujarat. His country is close to
the sea. Bih&#257;r&#299; and the J&#257;m are from one stem. They were
united ten generations ago. As far as territory and forces go, the
standing of Bih&#257;r&#299; is greater than that of the J&#257;m. They
say that he never came to see any of the Sultans of Gujarat.
Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d had sent an army against him, but
in the fight the army of Mah&#803;m&#363;d was defeated. At the time
when K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am went to conquer the fort of
J&#363;n&#257;ga&#7771;h in the country of S&#363;rat, Nann&#363;, who
was called Sult&#804;&#257;n Muz&#804;affar, and gave himself out as
heir to the kingdom, was passing his days in a state of misery under
the protection of the zamindars. After this the J&#257;m was defeated
in battle with the victorious (Royal) army, and Nann&#363; took refuge
with R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299;. K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am
demanded Nann&#363; from R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299;, and as he could not
oppose the Royal army, he gave him up, and by this piece of loyalty was
saved from the blows of the victorious army. At the time<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e780src" href="#xd24e780" name="xd24e780src">44</a>
when Ahmadabad was adorned by the presence of the retinue of fortune
for a short time, he did not come to wait on me. His country was
somewhat distant, and time did not admit of the appointing of a force
(against him). When it happened that I returned there, my son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n appointed Raja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t with an
army (for this purpose), and he, seeing his own safety in coming in
hastened to receive the honour of kissing the threshold, giving 200
<i>muhars</i> and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>Rs. 2,000 as naz&#817;r, and 100 horses.
However, there was not one of his horses that I approved of. His age
appeared to me to be more than eighty<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e788src" href="#xd24e788" name="xd24e788src">45</a> years, and he
himself said he was ninety. In his senses and powers there was no
appearance of decay. Among his men there was an old man with white
beard, moustaches, and eyebrows. He said that R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299;
remembered him when he (the old man) was a child (infant), and that he
had grown up from childhood in his service.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e793src" href="#xd24e793" name="xd24e793src">46</a> the
painter, who has been honoured with the title of
N&#257;diru-z-zam&#257;n, drew the picture of my accession as the
frontispiece to the Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma, and brought it to me.
As it was worthy of all praise, he received endless favours. His work
was perfect, and his picture is one of the <i lang="fr">chefs
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of the age. At the present time he has no rival
or equal. If at this day the masters &#703;Abdu-l-H&#803;ayy and
Bihz&#257;d were alive, they would have done him justice. His father,
&#256;q&#257; Riz&#803;&#257;&#702;&#299;, of Herat,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e799src" href="#xd24e799" name="xd24e799src">47</a> at the time
when I was Prince, joined my service. He (Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan) was a
<i>k&#863;h&#257;naz&#257;d</i> of my Court. There is, however, no
comparison between his work and that of his father (<i>i.e.</i>, he is
far better than his father). One cannot put them into the same
category. My connection was based on my having reared him. From his
earliest years up to the present time I have always looked after him,
till his art has arrived at this rank. Truly he has become
N&#257;dira-i-zam&#257;n (&ldquo;the wonder of the age&rdquo;). Also,
Ust&#257;d Man&#7779;&#363;r<a class="noteref" id="xd24e809src" href=
"#xd24e809" name="xd24e809src">48</a> has become such a master in
painting that he has the title of N&#257;diru-l-&#703;A&#7779;r, and in
the art of drawing is unique in his generation. In the time of my
father&rsquo;s reign and my own these two have had no third. As regards
myself, my liking for painting and my practice in judging it have
arrived at such a point that when any work is brought before me, either
of deceased artists or of those of the present day, without the names
being told me, I say on the spur of the moment that it is the work of
such and such a man. And if there be a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>picture containing many
portraits, and each face be the work of a different master, I can
discover which face is the work of each of them. If any other person
has put in the eye and eyebrow of a face, I can perceive whose work the
original face is, and who has painted the eye and eyebrows.</p>
<p class="par">On the eve of Sunday, the 31st of the month of T&#299;r,
heavy rain fell, and it went on raining with great violence till
Tuesday, the 1st of Amurd&#257;d.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e816src"
href="#xd24e816" name="xd24e816src">49</a> For sixteen days there were
constantly clouds and (? or) rain. As this is a sandy country, and the
buildings in it are weak, many houses fell, and many lives were lost. I
heard from the inhabitants of the city that they remembered no rain
like that of this year. Although the channel of the
S&#257;barmat&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e819src" href="#xd24e819"
name="xd24e819src">50</a> appears full of water, it is in most places
fordable, and elephants can always cross it. If for a day there has
been no rain, horses and men can ford it. The fountain head of this
river is in the hill-country of the R&#257;n&#257;. It comes out from
the ravine of Kokra(?),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e822src" href=
"#xd24e822" name="xd24e822src">51</a> and, having traversed 1&frac12;
<i>koss</i>, passes below M&#299;rp&#363;r,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e828src" href="#xd24e828" name="xd24e828src">52</a> and in this
place they call it the W&#257;kal (?). After passing 3 <i>koss</i>
beyond M&#299;rp&#363;r, they call it the S&#257;barmat&#299;.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 10th, R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299; was
exalted with the favour of a male and a female elephant, a jewelled
dagger, and four rings, of red ruby and yellow ruby (topaz), sapphire,
and emerald. Before this, the &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q J&#257;n-sip&#257;r
(life-jeoparding), K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n
(&#703;Abdu-r-Rah&#803;&#299;m), Commander-in-Chief, by order, had sent
a force under the leadership of his son Amru-llah<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e837src" href="#xd24e837" name="xd24e837src">53</a> towards
Gondw&#257;na, in order to seize the diamond mine of
Bar&#257;kar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e840src" href="#xd24e840" name=
"xd24e840src">54</a> (?) that was in the possession of Panj&#363;, a
Zamindar of Khandesh. On this day a report came from him that the
aforesaid Zamindar, knowing that opposition to the victorious army was
beyond his power, had made an offering of the mine, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>and a
royal superintendent had been appointed to manage it. The diamonds of
that place are superior in kind and beauty to all other kinds of
diamonds, and much esteemed by jewellers. They are of good shape, and
larger, and superior. Of the second rank is the mine of
Kokhra,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e845src" href="#xd24e845" name=
"xd24e845src">55</a> which is on the borders of Bihar; but the diamonds
of that place are not obtained from the mine, but from a river which in
the rainy season comes down in flood from the hills. Before that they
dam it up, and when the flood has passed over the dam and there is
little water, a number of men who are skilled in this art go into the
river bed and bring out the diamonds. It is now three years since this
country came into the possession of the State. The Zamindar of the
place is in confinement. The climate of that land is excessively
poisonous, and strangers cannot live there. The third place is in the
province of the Karnatik (Carnatic), near the frontier of
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. At a distance of 50 <i>koss</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e850src" href="#xd24e850" name="xd24e850src">56</a> there are
four mines. Many very fine<a class="noteref" id="xd24e857src" href=
"#xd24e857" name="xd24e857src">57</a> diamonds are obtained there.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 10th, N&#257;hir K. was promoted to the
man&#7779;ab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse, and he was presented
with an elephant. Makt&#363;b K., superintendent of the
<i>Kutub-k&#863;h&#257;na</i> (library), was given the man&#7779;ab of
1,500 personal. As I had ordered that on the S&#863;hab-i-Bar&#257;t
they should place lamps round the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank, at the end
of the day on Monday, the 14th Sha&#703;b&#257;n, I went out to look at
them. The buildings all round the tank they had arranged with lanterns
of different colours and all kinds of artifices that are practicable
with lamps, and fireworks. Although at this season there were
continually clouds and rain, by God&rsquo;s favour from the beginning
of the night the air had become clear, and not a trace of cloud
remained, and the lights shone just as one could wish. My domestic
servants were regaled with the cups of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>joy. I ordered them to
light lamps in the same manner on the eve of Friday, and a strange
thing was that at the close of the day of Thursday, the 17th, it
continually rained (<i>mutta&#7779;il b&#257;r&#299;dag&#299;</i>), but
at the time of lighting the lamps the rain ceased, and the show was
well seen. On this day I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula presented an offering
of a <i>qut&#804;b&#299;</i> (?) sapphire exceedingly delicate, and an
elephant without tusks with silver housings. As it was handsome-looking
and of good shape, it was put among my private elephants. On the bank
of the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank a <i>sany&#257;s&#299;</i>, one of the
most austere sects of Hindus, had made a hut after the dervish manner,
and lived as a hermit. As I was always inclined to associate with
dervishes, I hastened without ceremony to interview him, and for a
while enjoyed his society. He was not wanting in information and
reasonableness, and was well informed according to the rules of his own
faith in the doctrines of Sufism. He had conformed to the ways of
people of religious poverty and mortification, and given up all desires
and ambitions. One might say that a better than he of his class was
never seen.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 21st (Amurd&#257;d), the
<i>s&#257;ras</i>, the pairing of which has been related in the
preceding pages, collected together some straw and rubbish in the
little garden, and laid first of all one egg. On the third day
(afterwards) it laid a second egg. This pair of <i>s&#257;ras</i> were
caught when they were a month old,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e892src"
href="#xd24e892" name="xd24e892src">58</a> and had been in my
establishment for five years. After five and a half years they paired,
and continued doing so for a month; on the 21st of the month of
Amurd&#257;d, which the Hindus call S&#257;wan (Sr&#257;van) the hen
laid the eggs. The female used to sit on the eggs the whole night
alone, and the male stood near her on guard. It was so alert that it
was impossible for any living thing to pass near her. Once a large
weasel made its appearance, and he ran at it with the greatest
impetuosity, and did not stop until the weasel got into a hole. When
the sun illuminated the world with his rays, the male went to the
female and pecked her back with his beak. The female then rose, and the
male sate in her place. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>She returned, and in the same manner
made him rise, and seated herself. In short, the female sits the whole
night, and takes care of the eggs, and by day the male and female sit
by turns. When they rise and sit down they take great precautions that
no harm shall come to the eggs.</p>
<p class="par">During this season, as there was still some of the
hunting time left, Gajpat K., the darogha, and Bal&#363;ch K., the head
huntsman, had been left to hunt elephants, to catch as many as they
possibly could. In the same manner the huntsmen of my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, had also been employed. On this day they
came and waited on me. Altogether 185 elephants had been caught, male
and female: of these, 73 were males and 112 females. Out of these, 47
males and 75 females, or 122, the imperial huntsmen and faujd&#257;rs
had secured, while the huntsmen and elephant-drivers of my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, had taken 26 males and 37 females, or 63
altogether.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 24th, I went to see the
B&#257;g&#863;h-i-Fath&#803;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e903src" href=
"#xd24e903" name="xd24e903src">59</a> and spent two days there in
enjoyment and pleasure. At the end of the day on Saturday I returned to
the palace. As &#256;&#7779;af K. had represented that his
<i>h&#803;aw&#299;l&#299;</i> (house) garden was exceedingly green and
pleasant, and all sorts of flowers and scented plants had bloomed
there, at his request I went to it on <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i>
(Thursday), the 31st. In truth, it was a very nice villa, and I was
much pleased. His offering of jewels and jewelled things, and cloth, of
the value of Rs. 35,000, was accepted. Muz&#804;affar K. was favoured
with a dress of honour and an elephant, and, as before, was entrusted
with the charge of the government of Thatta (Sind). My brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s sent a letter with some trifling
presents by &#703;Abdu-l-Kar&#299;m of G&#299;l&#257;n, who had come
with merchandise from &#298;r&#257;n. On this day I presented him with
a dress of honour and an elephant, and gave him leave to return, and
sent an answer to the Shah&rsquo;s letter with a memorandum.
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam was also honoured with a gracious
farman and a special dress of honour. Friday was the 1st of the month
of S&#863;hahr&#299;war. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>From Sunday, the 3rd, till the eve of
Thursday (the 7th) rain fell. It is strange that on other days the pair
of <i>s&#257;ras</i> sate on the eggs five or six times in turn, but
during this twenty-four hours, when there was constant rain and the air
was somewhat cold, the male, in order to keep the eggs warm, sate from
early in the morning until midday, and from that time until the next
morning the female sat without an interval, for fear that in rising and
sitting again the cold air should affect them, and the eggs become wet
and be spoilt. Briefly, men are led by the guidance of Reason, and
animals according to the Divine wisdom implanted in them by Nature.
Stranger still is it that at first they keep their eggs together
underneath the breast, and after fourteen or fifteen days have passed
they leave a little space between them, for fear the heat should become
too great from their contact with each other. Many become addled in
consequence of (too great) heat.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 7th, with great joy and congratulation,
the advance camp was started towards Agra. The astrologers and
astronomers had already fixed the auspicious hour for the march. As
excessive rain fell, the main camp could not cross the river of
Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d (the V&#257;trak) and the
M&#257;h&#299; at this hour. Out of necessity, the advanced camp was
started at the appointed hour, and the 21st
S&#863;hahr&#299;war<a class="noteref" id="xd24e920src" href=
"#xd24e920" name="xd24e920src">60</a> was fixed for the march of the
main camp.</p>
<p class="par">My son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n took upon himself the
responsibility of the conquest of the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a, over
which the noose of victory had not been thrown by any of the Sultans of
lofty dignity, and an army under the leadership of R&#257;ja S&#363;raj
Mal, s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, and Taq&#299;, who was one of his attached
servants, had before this been sent for that purpose. It was now clear
that the conquest could not be achieved by the force that had been
previously appointed. R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e925src" href="#xd24e925" name="xd24e925src">61</a> who was one

<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 12th, Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299;,
huntsman, was brought to punishment. The details of this are that he is
the son of H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Jam&#257;l Bal&#363;ch, who was my
father&rsquo;s best huntsman, and after his (the
King&rsquo;s<span class="corr" id="xd24e980" title="Source: death)">)
death,</span> he entered the service of Isl&#257;m K., and went with
him to Bengal. Isl&#257;m K&#863;h&#257;n, on account of his
(Subh&#803;&#257;n Qul&#299;&rsquo;s) connection with this Court,
showed him proper consideration, and considering him trustworthy always
kept him near him when travelling or hunting. &#703;Us&#804;m&#257;n,
the Afghan, who for many years passed his days in that Subah in
disobedience and stubbornness, and the end of whose affairs has been
recorded in the preceding pages, being much troubled by Isl&#257;m
K&#863;h&#257;n, sent someone to this wretch, and made proposals for
his murdering Isl&#257;m. He undertook the business, and associated two
or three other men with himself. By chance, before the futile idea of
this ungrateful fellow was carried into execution, one of them came and
informed him (Isl&#257;m K.). Isl&#257;m K. immediately seized and
imprisoned the scoundrel. After the latter&rsquo;s death he came to
Court. As his brothers and relatives were included among the huntsmen,
he was also ordered to be enrolled among them. At this time the son
(Ikr&#257;m K.) of Isl&#257;m K. represented in an enigmatical way that
he was unworthy of service near my person. After explanation it
appeared what the charge was. Notwithstanding this, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>as his
brothers strenuously represented that there was only suspicion, and
Bal&#363;ch K., the head huntsman, became security for him, I forbore
to put him to death, and ordered him to do duty with Bal&#363;ch K. In
spite of this grace and the gift of his life, without cause or motive
he fled from the Court, and went to Agra and that neighbourhood.
Bal&#363;ch K., having become his security, was ordered to produce him.
He sent people to inquire for him. In one of the villages of Agra,
which was not wanting in sedition, and is called Jahanda,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e985src" href="#xd24e985" name="xd24e985src">69</a>
the brother of Bal&#363;ch K&#863;h&#257;n, who had gone to make
inquiries, found him, and although he endeavoured to bring him by
persuasion to Court, he would in no way consent, and the people rose to
assist him.</p>
<p class="par">Being without remedy, he (the brother) went to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n at Agra, and told him the circumstances.
He sent a detachment against that village to take him by force and
bring him. The people of the village, seeing their own ruin in the
mirror of the case, handed him over to him. This day he came to Court
in chains. I gave an order for his execution. The man of wrath (the
executioner) took him to the place of punishment with all haste. After
a while, through the intercession of one of the courtiers, I gave him
his life, and ordered his feet to be cut off, but according to his
destiny (what was written on his head) before the order arrived he had
been punished. Although that doomed man was deserving of punishment,
yet I regretted<a class="noteref" id="xd24e990src" href="#xd24e990"
name="xd24e990src">70</a> the circumstance, and directed that whenever
an order was given for anyone&rsquo;s execution, notwithstanding that
the command were imperative, they should wait till sunset before
putting him to death. If up to that time no order for release arrived,
he should without fail be capitally punished.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday there was a great commotion in the River
M&#257;h&#299;, and very large waves were visible. Although there
formerly had been (great) rains, yet such violence, or even the half of
it, had never been known. From the beginning of the day the flood began
to come, and at the end of the day began to <span class=

that once, during the government of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. (Far&#299;d

<p class="par">On Friday, the 15th, a Mull&#257; of the name of
Am&#299;r&#299;, an old man, came from M&#257;-war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr
(Transoxiana), and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. He
represented to me that he was one of the ancient (servants) of
&#703;Abdu-llah K&#863;h&#257;n Uzbeg, and from the days of
infancy<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1071src" href="#xd24e1071" name=

K&#863;h&#257;n until now he had passed his days respected in that
country. He had left his native country with a view to visit the
blessed house (Mecca), and had come to pay his respects to me. I made
him free to remain or go. He asked to remain in attendance on me for
some days. Rs. 1,000 for expenses and a dress of honour were given him.
He is an old man of very pleasing face, and full of talk and anecdote.
My son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n also gave him Rs. 500 and a robe of
honour.</p>
<p class="par">In the middle of the garden of K&#863;hurram
(S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s) residence there is a bench and a
reservoir. On one side<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1085src" href=

M&#363;lsar&#299;-tree (<i>Mimusops elengi</i>) against which to lean
the back. As in one side of its trunk there was a hollow to the extent
of three-fourths of a yard, it had an ugly look. I ordered them to cut
a tablet of marble and fix it firmly in that place, so that one could
lean one&rsquo;s back on it and sit there. At this time an impromptu
couplet came to my tongue, and I ordered the stone-cutters to engrave
it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=

bazaar was arranged in the private palace. Up to this time the custom
has been for the people of the bazaar and the artificers of the city in
every place to bring their shops according to order into the courtyard
of the palace (royal abode, whether in camp or elsewhere), and bring
jewels and jewelled things and various kinds of cloth and other goods
such as are sold in the bazaar. It occurred to me that if a bazaar were
prepared in the night-time, and a number of lamps were arranged in
front of the shops, it would look well. Undoubtedly it came off well
and was unusual. Going round all the shops, whatever jewels and
jewelled things pleased me I bought. I gave some present from each shop
to Mull&#257; Am&#299;r&#299;, and he received so many things that he
was unable to hold them.</p>

(September 2, 1618), in the Hijr&#299; year 1027, when two and a half
hours of day had passed, in prosperity and happiness, the standards of
purpose turned towards the capital of Agra. From the palace as far as
the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank, the place of alighting, I passed along in
the usual manner, scattering money
(<i>nis&#804;&#257;r-kun&#257;n</i>). On the same day the feast of my
solar weighment took place, and according to solar reckoning the
fiftieth year of the age of his suppliant at the throne of God
commenced auspiciously. According to my usual rule I weighed myself
against gold and other valuables. I scattered pearls and golden roses,
and looking at night at the show of lamps passed my time in the private
apartments of the royal abode in enjoyment. On Friday, the 22nd, I
ordered that all the S&#863;haik&#863;hs and men of piety who lived in
the city should be brought in order that they might break their
fast<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1111src" href="#xd24e1111" name=

after thirty-four<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1145src" href="#xd24e1145"

One might say that they were one-tenth<a class="noteref" id=

the young of a goose, or equal to the young of the peafowl at the age
of a month. Their skin was of a blue colour. On the first day they ate
nothing, and from the second day the mother, taking small locusts (or
grasshoppers) in her mouth, sometimes fed them like a pigeon, or
sometimes like a fowl threw them before them for them to pick up of
themselves. If the locust were small, it went off well, but if it were
large, she sometimes made two or three pieces of it so that the young
ones might eat it with ease. As I had a great liking for seeing them I
ordered them to be brought before me with every precaution that no harm
might happen to them. After I had seen them I ordered them to be taken
back to the same little garden inside <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

to be preserved with the greatest care, and that they should be brought

very bad, Mah&#803;m&#363;d B&#299;gara, by the advice of his
physicians, founded a city on the bank of the aforesaid river and lived
there. After he conquered Ch&#257;mp&#257;ner, he made that place his
capital, and until the time of Mah&#803;m&#363;d the martyred<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e1170src" href="#xd24e1170" name=

Mah&#803;m&#363;d was the last of the Sultans of Gujarat, and he took
up his residence at Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d. Undoubtedly the
water and air of Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d have no resemblance to
those of Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d. By way of testing this I ordered
them to hang up a sheep on the bank of the K&#257;nkr&#299;ya tank
after taking off its skin, and at the same time one at
Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d, that the difference of the air might
be ascertained. It happened that after seven <i>ghar&#299;s</i> of day
had passed in that place (Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d) they hung up the
sheep. When three <i>ghar&#299;s</i> of day remained it became so
changed and putrid that it was difficult to pass near it. They hung up
the sheep at Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d in the morning, and it was
altogether unchanged until the evening, and began to be putrid when one
and a half watches of night had passed. Briefly, in the neighbourhood
of Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d it became putrid in eight sidereal hours,
and in Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d in fourteen hours.</p>

S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;&#256;lam, to ask for whatever he desired without
concealment, and I took an oath on the Qoran to this effect. He said
that as I had sworn on the Qoran he would ask for a Qoran that he might
always have it by him, and that the merit of reading it might accrue to
His Majesty. Accordingly, I gave the M&#299;r a Qoran in
Y&#257;q&#363;t&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1195src" href=

back of it I wrote with my own hand that I had made this gift on a
certain day and in a certain place to Sayyid Muh&#803;ammad. The real
reason for this is that the M&#299;r is of an exceedingly good
disposition, endowed with personal nobility and acquired excellencies,
of good manners and approved ways, with a very pleasing face and open
forehead. I have never seen a man of this country of such a pleasing
disposition as the M&#299;r. I told him to translate this Qoran into

decrease somewhat my usual number of cups. According to their advice I
began to decrease their number, and in the course of a week reduced
them by the weight of one cup. At first it was six cups every evening,
each cup being 7&frac12; <i>tola</i>, or altogether 45 <i>tolas</i>.

this date I have reached the commencement of my fiftieth year, and one
day, in consequence of excessive fever (<i>d&#363;d u

in this condition the compact I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"

fortune to pay his respects. He laid before me some diamonds he had
obtained from the mine of Kokra. Approved service had not been
performed in that province by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K., and it
was also frequently reported that certain of his brothers and

did not regard the authority of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;. On this
account a farman written with my own hand was given to Muqarrab K., one
of my confidential old servants, stating that he was appointed Governor
of Bihar. I ordered that immediately on receipt of the farman he should
hasten to that quarter. Some of the diamonds that Ibr&#257;h&#299;m
Fath&#803;-jang had sent to Court after the taking of the mine had been
given to the Government lapidaries to cut. At this time Bahr&#257;m
suddenly came to Agra, and was going on to the Court (in Gujarat).
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n (the Governor of Agra) sent along with him
some diamonds that were ready. One of them is of a violet<a class=

had been white (<i>safid</i>) and had had perfect marks, it would have
been worth Rs. 20,000.</p>
<p class="par">This year I had mangoes up to the 6th Mihr (middle of

K&#257;k&#363; (or Gang&#363;), which were very pleasant and large

a bridge over the M&#257;h&#299;, with instructions not to wait till it
was fordable, so that the victorious camp might cross at ease. On
Tuesday, the 9th, there was a halt, and on <i>Kams&#863;hamba</i>

<p class="par">At first the male <i>s&#257;ras</i> used to hold its
young one by its leg upside down in his beak, and there was a fear that
he might be unkind to it and it might be destroyed. I accordingly
ordered them to keep the male separately, and not allow it near its
young ones. I now ordered by way of experiment that it should be
allowed near them, that the real degree of its unkindness and affection
might be ascertained. After allowing it, he displayed much attachment
and kindness, and his affection was found to be no less than that of
the female; I thus knew that this performance was out of real love. On
Thursday, the 11th, there was a halt, and at the end of the day I went
to hunt with cheetahs, and two black buck, four does, and a
<i>chik&#257;ra</i> were caught. On Sunday, the 14th, I also went to
hunt with cheetahs, and caught fifteen head of male and female
antelopes. I had ordered Rustam and Suhr&#257;b<a class="noteref" id=

K&#863;h&#257;n, his son, to go out hunting and shoot as many nilgaw as
they could. The father and son together killed seven head, male and
female. As it was represented to me that there was a tiger in this
neighbourhood, a man-killer that had taken to eating men&rsquo;s flesh,
and the people of God were afflicted by it, I ordered my son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n to save them from its wickedness. He, as
ordered, shot it with his gun, and brought it to me at night. I ordered
them to skin it in my presence. Although large in appearance, as it was
thin, it turned out less in weight than the large tigers I had myself
killed. On Monday, the 15th, and Tuesday, the 16th, I went to shoot
nilgaw, and on each day shot two blue bulls. On Thursday, the 18th, on
the bank of a tank at which I pitched, a feast of cups was held. Rare
lotus (kanwal) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

private servants enjoyed themselves greatly with cups of wine.
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; had sent twenty elephants from Bihar, and
Muruwwat K. eight from Bengal, and these were brought before me. One of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299;&rsquo;s and two of Muruwwat&rsquo;s were
placed in my private stud, and the rest were divided amongst my
followers. M&#299;r K., s. M&#299;rz&#257; Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim
Namak&#299;n, who was one of the khanazads of this Court, was promoted

Qiy&#257;m K. was appointed to the duty of chief huntsman, and had
given him the rank of 600 personal and 150 horse.

bull. I do not remember a bullet passing through a large male nilgaw.
Many have passed through females. On this day, at a distance of
forty-five paces (<i>qadam</i>), it went through both skins. In the
language of hunters a <i>qadam</i> means two feet
(<i>g&#257;m</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e1411src" href="#xd24e1411"

M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, D&#257;r&#257;b K., M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n,
and other servants to go and shoot as many nilgaw as they could. They
killed nineteen head, male and female. Ten head of antelope were also
caught with cheetahs. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K., Bakhshi of the Deccan, was,
at the request of the Commander-in-Chief, K&#863;h&#257;n
K&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and
200 horse. On Monday, the 22nd, a march was made, and on Tuesday, the
23rd, I again marched. The huntsmen represented that there had been
seen in the neighbourhood a tigress with three cubs. As it was on the
road I went myself after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>them and shot all four, and then went
on to the next stage. I crossed the M&#257;h&#299; by the bridge that
had been made. Though there were no boats on this river of which a
bridge could be made, and the water was very deep and flowing rapidly,
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the chief Bakhshi, had built
with great exertions a very strong bridge two or<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1419src" href="#xd24e1419" name="xd24e1419src">104</a> three days
before. Its length was 140 yards and its breadth 4 yards
(<i>dara&#703;</i>). By way of testing it I ordered the elephant Gun
Sundar K&#863;h&#257;&#7779;&#7779; which is one of the large and
strong elephants, with three females, to be sent across it. It was so
firmly built that its supports did not shake with the weight of
elephants of mountainous form.</p>
<p class="par">From the most honoured lips of my father I heard as
follows: &ldquo;In early youth I had taken two or three cups (of wine),
and had mounted a full-blooded (<i>mast</i>) elephant. Though I was in
my senses, and the elephant in very good training, and was under my
control, I pretended that I was out of my senses, and that the elephant
was refractory and vicious, and that I was making him charge the
people. After that, I sent for another elephant, and made the two
fight. They fought, and in doing so went to the head of the bridge that
had been made over the Jumna. It happened that the other elephant ran
away, and as there was no other escape, he went towards the bridge. The
elephant I was on pursued him, and although I had him under control,
and he would have halted at the slightest signal, I thought that if I
held him back from the bridge the people would regard those drunken
ways (of mine) as a sham, and would believe that neither was I beside
myself, nor was the elephant violent and headstrong. Such pretences on
the part of kings are disapproved of, and so after imploring the aid of
God&mdash;Glory be to Him&mdash;I did not restrain my elephant. Both of
them went upon the bridge, and as it was made of boats, whenever an
elephant put his forefeet on the edge of a boat, half of it sank, and
the other half stood up. At each step there came the thought that the
lashings might give way. People on seeing this were overwhelmed in the
sea <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>of perplexity and alarm. As the care and
guardianship of the Great and Glorious God is ever and in all places
the protection of this suppliant, both elephants crossed the bridge in
safety.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1432src" href="#xd24e1432"

<p class="par">On Thursday, the 25th, a wine-feast was held on the
banks of the M&#257;h&#299;, and some of my intimate servants who had
admittance to such assemblies had their hearts delighted by brimming
cups and ample favours. Certainly it was an entrancing halting-ground.
I stayed here four days for two reasons&mdash;first, because of the
beauty of the spot, and secondly in order that the people might not be
confused in crossing the river.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 28th, I marched from the bank of the
M&#257;h&#299;. On Monday I marched again. On this day a strange sight
was witnessed. The pair of s&#257;ras that had had young ones had been
brought from Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d on Thursday (the 25th). In the
Court of the royal enclosure, which had been placed on the bank of a
tank, they were walking about with their young ones. By chance both the
male and female raised a cry, and a pair of wild s&#257;ras hearing it,
and crying out from the other side of the tank, came flying towards
them. The male with the male, and the female with the female, engaged
in a fight, and although some people were standing about, the birds
paid no heed to them. The eunuchs who had been told off to protect them
hastened to seize them. One clung to the male and the other to the
female. He who had caught the male kept hold of it after much
struggling, but the one who seized the female could not hold her, and
she escaped from his hand. I with my own hand put rings in his beak and
on his legs, and set him free. Both went and settled in their own
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1439src" href="#xd24e1439" name=
"xd24e1439src">106</a> Whenever the domestic s&#257;ras raised a cry
they responded. I saw a sight of this kind in wild antelopes when I had
gone to hunt in the pargana of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"
href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>Karn&#257;l. About thirty of my
huntsmen and servants were in attendance when a black buck with some
does came in sight, and we let loose the decoy-antelope<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e1444src" href="#xd24e1444" name=
"xd24e1444src">107</a> to fight him. They butted two or three times,
and then the decoy came back. A second time I wanted to put a noose on
its horns and to let it go, that it might capture (the wild one).
Meanwhile the wild antelope, in the excess of its rage, not looking at
the crowd of men, ran without regard to anything, and butting the tame
buck two or three times fought with it till it fled. The wild antelope
thereupon made its escape.</p>
<p class="par">On this day news came of the death of &#703;In&#257;yat
K. He was one of my intimate attendants. As he was addicted to opium,
and when he had the chance, to drinking as well, by degrees he became
maddened with wine. As he was weakly built, he took more than he could
digest, and was attacked by the disease of diarrh&oelig;a, and in this
weak state he two or three times fainted. By my order H&#803;ak&#299;m
Rukn&#257; applied remedies, but whatever methods were resorted to gave
no profit. At the same time a strange hunger came over him, and
although the doctor exerted himself in order that he should not eat
more than once in twenty-four hours, he could not restrain himself. He
also would throw<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1449src" href="#xd24e1449"
name="xd24e1449src">108</a> himself like a madman on water and fire
until he fell into a bad<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1452src" href=
"#xd24e1452" name="xd24e1452src">109</a> state of body. At last he
became dropsical, and exceedingly low and weak. Some days before this
he had petitioned that he might go to Agra. I ordered him to come into
my presence and obtain leave. They put him into a palanquin and brought
him. He appeared so low and weak that I was astonished.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;He was skin drawn over bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">Or rather his bones, too, had dissolved. Though

</div>
<p class="par first">As it was a very extraordinary case I directed
painters to take his portrait. In fact, I found him wonderfully
changed. I said to him: &ldquo;Beware; in your present state do not for
a moment forget God, nor despair of His mercy! If Death grant you
quarter (<i>am&#257;n</i>), regard the reprieve as a time for
apologizing and for amendment. If your life has come to its close,
consider every moment passed in remembrance of God as gain. Trouble not
your head about those you are leaving behind. A slight claim of service
is a great thing with us.&rdquo; As they had spoken to me about his
poverty, I gave him Rs. 2,000 for road-expenses, and let him go. Next
day he travelled the road of non-existence.</p>

was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 300<a class="noteref"

and 800 horse. &#703;Abdu-llah, son of K&#863;h&#257;n
A&#703;z&#804;am, obtained the mansab of 1,000 personal and 300 horse.
Dil&#299;r K., who was one of the jagirdars of Gujarat, I presented
with a horse and an elephant. Ran-b&#257;z K., s.
S&#863;h&#257;h-b&#257;z K. K&#257;mb&#363;, came by order from the
Deccan, and was promoted to the post of Bakhshi and Recorder of the
army of Bangas&#863;h, and his mansab was fixed at 800 personal and 400
horse. I marched on Friday, the 3rd. At this stage<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e1506src" href="#xd24e1506" name="xd24e1506src">114</a> Prince
S&#863;huj&#257;&#703;, the beloved son (liver-corner) of my son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, who was being brought up in the chaste lap
of N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam, and towards whom I have so much affection
that he is dearer to me than life, was attacked by a specially
infantile disease which they call
&ldquo;ummu-&#7779;-&#7779;iby&#257;n,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1510src" href="#xd24e1510" name="xd24e1510src">115</a> and for a
long time his senses left him. Although experienced people devised many
remedies, they were unprofitable, and his insensibility
(<i>b&#299;-h&#363;s&#863;h&#299;</i>) took away my senses
(<i>h&#363;s&#863;h</i>). As visible remedies were hopeless, by way of
humility and submission I rubbed the head of supplication on the Court
of the gracious Ruler who cherishes his slaves, and begged for the
child&rsquo;s recovery. In this state it occurred to me that as I had
made a vow<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1519src" href="#xd24e1519" name=
"xd24e1519src">116</a> to my God that after I had passed my fiftieth
year, this suppliant would give up hunting with bullet and gun, and
would injure no creature with his own hand, if for the sake of his
safety I were to give up shooting from the present date, it were
possible that his life would become the means of preserving the lives
of many animals, and God Almighty might give him to me. In fine, with
true purpose, and sincere belief I vowed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1522src" href="#xd24e1522" name="xd24e1522src">117</a> to God
that I would thenceforward not harm any living thing with my own hand.
By the grace of Allah his illness diminished. At the time when this
suppliant was in his mother&rsquo;s womb, one day I made no movement
after the manner that other children make. The attendants were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>amazed, and inquiring into the cause stated the
case to my father (Akbar). At that time my father was engaged in
hunting with cheetahs. As that day was a Friday, for the purpose of my
safety he made a vow that during his life he would not hunt with
cheetahs on a Friday. Till the end of his life he remained firm in this
determination, and I also in obedience to him until now have never
hunted with cheetahs on a Friday. Finally, on account of the weakness
of the light of my eye, S&#863;h&#257;h S&#863;huj&#257;&#703;, for
three days I halted at this stage, that God Almighty might give him his
natural<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1531src" href="#xd24e1531" name=
"xd24e1531src">118</a> life.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 7th, I marched. One day the son of
H&#803;ak&#299;m<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1536src" href="#xd24e1536"
name="xd24e1536src">119</a> &#703;&#256;l&#299; was praising the milk
of a camel. It occurred to me that if I could continue that for some
days, it was possible that it might do some good, and it might prove
agreeable to me. &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n had a Persian camel in
milk, and I took a little of it. Contrary to the milk of other camels,
which is not devoid of saltness, it appeared to my taste sweet and
delicious, and now for a month past I have been drinking every day a
cup of it, equal in quantity to half a water-cup, and it is clearly
advantageous, for it quenches my thirst. It is strange that two years
ago &#256;&#7779;af K. bought this camel, but at that time it had not a
young one, and had no sign of milk. At this time by chance milk flowed
from its dugs. They gave it every day to drink four seers of
cow&rsquo;s milk with five seers of wheat, one seer of black<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e1539src" href="#xd24e1539" name=
"xd24e1539src">120</a> sugar, and one seer of fennel
(<i>b&#257;dy&#257;n</i>), to make its milk delicious, sweet, and
profitable. Certainly it suited me admirably, and was to my taste. By
way of testing it, I sent for some cow&rsquo;s and buffalo&rsquo;s
milk, and tasted all three. There was no comparison in sweetness and
flavour with the milk of this camel. I ordered them to give the same
kind of food to some other female camels, that it might become clear
whether the purity was in consequence of eating good food, or whether
it was due to the natural sweetness of this (particular) camel&rsquo;s
milk.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1547src" href="#xd24e1547" name=

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 8th, I marched, and halted on the 9th.
The royal tent was pitched near a large tank.
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n presented me with a boat made after the
Kashm&#299;r fashion, the sitting-place of which they had made of
silver. At the end of that day I embarked in that boat and went round
the tank. On this day &#703;&#256;bid K., Bakhshi of Bangas&#863;h, who
had been summoned, came and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold,
and was honoured with the post of D&#299;w&#257;n-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t.
Sar-far&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n, who was one of the auxiliaries of
Gujarat, received a standard, a private <i>tipch&#257;q</i> horse, and
an elephant, and, overwhelmed with honour, obtained leave to go.

attached to the army of Bangas&#863;h, was exalted with the gift of a
standard. Marching was ordered on Friday, the 10th. M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 600
horse. On Saturday, the 11th, the auspicious equipage alighted in the
pargana of Doh&#803;ad. On the eve of Sunday, the 12th of the
Il&#257;h&#299; month of &#256;b&#257;n, in the thirteenth year from my
accession, corresponding with the fifteenth Z&#817;&#299;-l-Qa&#703;da
of the Hijr&#299; year 1027, in the nineteenth degree of Libra, the
Giver of blessings gave my prosperous son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n a
precious son by the daughter of &#256;&#7779;af K. I hope that
his<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1560src" href="#xd24e1560" name=
"xd24e1560src">123</a> advent may be auspicious and blessed to this
everlasting State. Halting for three days at this place, on
Wednesday,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1566src" href="#xd24e1566" name=
"xd24e1566src">124</a> the 15th &#256;b&#257;n, the camp was pitched at
the village of S&#804;amarna.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1569src" href=
"#xd24e1569" name="xd24e1569src">125</a> As it was necessary that the
Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba entertainment should as far as possible be
arranged for on the bank of a river and a clean place, and there was in
this neighbourhood no spot which met those requirements, there was no
help for it but to order a start when half of the night of Thursday
(<i>i.e.</i>, Wednesday), the 16th, had passed, and when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>the sun
rose the camp was pitched on the bank of the tank of B&#257;kh&#363;r.
At the end of the day, the feast of cups was held and I presented cups
to some of my private servants. On Friday, the 17th, I ordered a march.
Kes&#863;ho D&#257;s M&#257;r&#363; is a jagirdar in that
neighbourhood. According to orders, he came from the Deccan, and was
honoured by doing homage.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 18th (&#256;b&#257;n), the camp was at
R&#257;mga&#7771;h. For some nights before this there appeared, at
three <i>ghar&#299;s</i> before sunrise, in the atmosphere, a
(luminous) vapour in the shape of a pillar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1583src" href="#xd24e1583" name="xd24e1583src">126</a> At each
succeeding night it rose a <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> earlier. When
it assumed its full form, it took the shape of a spear
(<i>h&#803;arba</i>), thin at the two ends, and thick in the middle. It
was curved like a sickle, and had its back to the south, and its face
to the north. It now showed itself a watch (<i>pahar</i>) before
sunrise. Astronomers took its shape and size by the astrolabe, and
ascertained that with differences of appearance (?) it extended over
twenty-four degrees. It moved in high heaven, but it had a movement of
its own, differing from that of high heaven, for it was first in
Scorpio and afterwards in Libra. Its declination
(<i>h&#803;arakat-i-&#703;arz&#803;</i>?) was mainly southerly.
Astrologers call such a phenomenon a spear (<i>h&#803;arba</i>) in
their books, and have written that its appearance portends weakness to
the kings of Arabia, and points to their enemies prevailing over them.
God knows! Sixteen nights after this phenomenon, a star showed itself
in the same quarter. Its head was luminous, and its tail was two or
three yards long, but the tail was not luminous. It has now appeared
for eight nights; when it disappears, the fact will be noticed, as well
as the results of it.</p>
<p class="par">I halted on Sunday, the 19th, and on Monday I alighted
at the village of S&#299;talkhera.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1613src"

the Afghan, with a robe of honour and an elephant, sending them to him
by Ran-b&#257;z K. On Wednesday, the 22nd, the camp rested in pargana
Madanp&#363;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1618src" href="#xd24e1618"
name="xd24e1618src">128</a> On Thursday, the 23rd, I halted and had a
feast of cups, and D&#257;r&#257;b K. had a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i>

was pitched in the pargana of Naw&#257;r&#299;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1624src" href="#xd24e1624" name="xd24e1624src">129</a> On Sunday,

the bank of the River Kahnar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1628src" href=
"#xd24e1628" name="xd24e1628src">130</a> (?). On Tuesday, the 28th, the
royal standards were raised in the neighbourhood of the city of Ujain.
From Ah&#803;mad&#257;b&#257;d to Ujain is a distance of ninety-eight
kos. It was traversed in twenty-eight marches and forty-one
halts&mdash;that is, in two months and nine days. On Wednesday, the
29th, I had an interview with Jadr&#363;p, who is one of the austere
ones of the Hindu religion, and the particulars of whose circumstances
have been described in the preceding pages, and went with him to see
K&#257;liy&#257;daha. Certainly association with him is a great
privilege.</p>
<p class="par">On this day it was made known to me in the contents of a
report from Bah&#257;dur K., the Governor of Qandahar, that in the
Hijr&#299; year 1026&mdash;that is, last year&mdash;the number of mice
in Qandahar and the neighbourhood was so great that they destroyed all
the crops and grain and cultivation and the fruits of the trees of the
province, so that there had been no produce. They (the mice) cut off
the ears of corn and ate them. When the cultivators gathered their
crops, before they were threshed and cleaned, another<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e1633src" href="#xd24e1633" name="xd24e1633src">131</a> half
was destroyed, so that perhaps one-fourth of the crops only came to
hand. In the same way no vestige was left of the melons (melon-beds) or
garden produce. After some time the mice disappeared. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n had not made a
birthday entertainment for his son (Aurangz&#299;b), he petitioned at
Ujain, which is the place of his jagir, that the Thursday entertainment
of the 30th should be held at his abode. Of necessity, having consented
to the carrying out of his wish, the day was passed in enjoyment at his
quarters. My private servants who have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into
this kind of parties and assemblies were delighted with brimming cups.
My son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n brought that auspicious child before
me, and, presenting as offerings a tray of jewels, and jewelled
ornaments, and fifty elephants, thirty male and twenty female, asked me
for a name for him. Please God it will be given him in a favourable
hour. Of his elephants seven were included in my private stud; the rest
were distributed among the faujd&#257;rs. The value of the offerings
that were accepted will be Rs. 200,000.</p>
<p class="par">On this day &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula
(Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain Anj&#363;) came from his jagir,
and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. He gave eighty-one
<i>muhars</i> as <i>naz&#817;r</i>, and an elephant as an offering.
Q&#257;sim K., whom I had dismissed from the government of Bengal, had
been sent for, and having had the good fortune to do homage, presented
1,000 <i>muhars</i> as <i>naz&#817;r</i>. On Friday, the 1st of
&#256;z&#817;ar, I amused myself with hawking. As the retinue passed
along, a field of millet (<i>jw&#257;r</i>) was met with. Though
generally a stem has only one head, each of them had twelve. I was
astonished, and at this time the tale of &ldquo;The King and the
Gardener&rdquo; occurred to me.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first"><span class="sc">Tale of &ldquo;The King and the
Gardener.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1665src" href=
"#xd24e1665" name="xd24e1665src">132</a></p>
<p class="par">A King came to the gate of a garden in the heat of the
day. He saw an old gardener standing at the gate, and asked him if
there were any pomegranates in the garden. He said: &ldquo;There
are.&rdquo; He told him to bring a cup of pomegranate juice. The
gardener had a daughter adorned with grace of person, and beauty of
disposition. He made a sign to her to bring the pomegranate juice. The
girl went and at once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51"
name="pb51">51</a>]</span>brought a cup full of pomegranate juice, and
placed some leaves upon it. The King took it from her hand and drank
it. Then he asked the girl what was her reason for placing leaves on
the top of the juice. She, with an eloquent tongue and a sweet voice,
represented that it was not wise at once to drink off a quantity of
liquid when he was bathed in perspiration, and in such a hot air. On
this account she had placed the leaves on the liquid by way of
precaution, so that he might drink it slowly. The King was greatly
pleased with her sweet ways, and it crossed his mind to admit the girl
into his Palace. After this he asked the gardener: &ldquo;How much
profit do you derive from this garden every year?&rdquo; He answered:
&ldquo;Three hundred <i>d&#299;n&#257;rs</i>.&rdquo; The King asked:
&ldquo;What do you pay the Diwan (tax-collector)?&rdquo; He answered:
&ldquo;The King takes nothing from the trees, but takes a tenth of the
cultivated crops.&rdquo; It came into the King&rsquo;s mind that there
were in his dominions many gardens and countless trees. If he were to
get a tenth of the garden produce as well, it would amount to a large
sum, and there would be no great loss to the cultivator. Hereafter he
would order a tax to be levied on garden produce. He said then:
&ldquo;Bring me a little more pomegranate juice.&rdquo; The girl went,
and after a long time brought a small quantity. The King said:
&ldquo;The first time thou camest quickly, and broughtest more. This
time thou didst stay a long time, and broughtest less.&rdquo; The girl
said: &ldquo;The first time I had filled the cup with the juice of one
pomegranate, and brought it; this time I pressed out five or six
pomegranates and did not get as much juice.&rdquo; The astonishment of
the King increased. The gardener represented: &ldquo;The blessing of
produce depends on the goodwill of the King. It occurs to me that you
must be a King. At the time when you inquired of me the income from the
garden, your disposition must have changed. Consequently the blessing
passed away from the fruit.&rdquo; The Sultan was impressed, and drove
that idea out of his heart. He then said: &ldquo;Bring me once more a
cup of pomegranate juice.&rdquo; The girl went again, and quickly
bringing a cup full to the brim, gave it, smiling and gladly, into the
Sultan&rsquo;s hand. He praised the intelligence of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>gardener, and explained the actual state of
affairs, and begged the girl of him in marriage, and married her.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This true tale of that truth-preserving King has
remained as a memento on the page of time. In truth, the manifestation
of such spiritual (?)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1680src" href=
"#xd24e1680" name="xd24e1680src">133</a> results is the mark of good
intentions, and the fruit of justice. Whenever all the energies and
purposes of justice-observing Kings are devoted to the comfort of the
people and the contentment of their subjects, the manifestations of
well-being and the productions of fields and gardens are not far off.
God be praised that in this age-enduring State no tax has ever been
levied on the fruit of trees, and is not levied now. In the whole of
the dominion not a <i>d&#257;m</i> nor one grain

<p class="par first">On Saturday, for the second time, my desire for
the company of Jadr&#363;p increased. After performing the midday
devotions, I embarked in a boat and hastened to meet him, and at the
close of day I ran and enjoyed his society in the retirement of his
cell. I heard many sublime words of religious duties and knowledge of
divine things. Without immoderate praise, he sets forth clearly the
doctrines of wholesome Sufism, and one can find delight in his society.
He is sixty years old. He was twenty-two years of age, when, forsaking
all external attachments, he placed the foot of determination on the
highroad of asceticism, and for thirty-eight years he had lived in the
garment of nakedness. When I took leave he said: &ldquo;In what
language can I return thanks for this gift of Allah that I am engaged
in the reign of such a just King in the worship of my own Deity in ease
and contentment, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=

accident settles not on the skirt of my purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 3rd, marching from K&#257;liy&#257;daha,
I encamped at the village of Q&#257;simkhera. I employed myself on the
road in hawking. By chance a crane rose, and the
<i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i> falcon, of which I am very fond, was let
fly after it. The crane sought to escape, and the falcon soared and
flew so high as to disappear from sight. Although the huntsmen and the
head-beaters ran after it in all directions, they found no trace of it,
and it was impossible for the falcon to be caught in such a desert.
Las&#863;hkar M&#299;r Kas&#863;hm&#299;r&#299;, who is the head of the
Kashmir huntsmen, in whose charge the falcon was, ran in a bewildered
state through the desert in all directions without finding a sign or
trace. Suddenly he saw a tree in the distance, and when he went up to
it he found the falcon sitting on the end of a branch. Showing a
domestic fowl, he called to the falcon. Three <i>ghar&#299;s</i> more
had not passed when he brought it to me. This gift from the hidden
world, that had entered into the thoughts of no one, increased the joy
of my mind. Increasing his mansab as a reward for this service, I gave
him a horse and a dress of honour.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 4th, Tuesday, the 5th, Wednesday, the
6th, I marched continuously, and, halting on Thursday, the 7th, I
arranged a feast of pleasure on the bank of a tank. N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n
Begam had been ill for some time, and the physicians who had the good
fortune to be chosen to attend on her, <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e1720" title="Source: Musalmans">Musulmans</span> and Hindus,
perceived no gain from all the medicines they gave her, and confessed
their helplessness in treating her. At this time H&#803;ak&#299;m
R&#363;h&#803;u-llah began to wait upon her, and undertook (to find) a
remedy. By the aid of God (Glory be to His name!), in a short time she
quite recovered. In reward for this excellent service I increased his
mansab and bestowed on the H&#803;ak&#299;m three villages in his
native country as his private property, and an order was given that he
should be weighed against silver, which should be given him as a
reward. From Friday, the 8th, until Sunday,<a class="noteref" id=

up to the end of the stage employed myself in hunting with hawks and
falcons (<i>b&#257;z u jurra</i>). Many <i>durr&#257;j</i> (partridges)
were caught. On last Sunday, Kunwar Karan, s. R&#257;n&#257; Amar
Singh, having enjoyed the good fortune of kissing the ground, presented
his congratulations on the conquest of the Deccan, offering 100
<i>muhars</i> and Rs. 1,000 by way of <i>naz&#817;r</i>, and the value
of Rs. 21,000 in jewelled vessels, with some horses and elephants as
<i>p&#299;s&#863;hkas&#863;h</i>. The horses and elephants I returned
to him, and the rest was accepted. The next day I presented him with a
dress of honour. To M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f, Vakil of
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, and to Ir&#257;dat K., the chief butler, an
elephant each was given. Sayyid Hizabr K. was given the faujd&#257;ri
of Mew&#257;t, and his mansab, original and increased, was fixed at
1,000 personal and 500 horse. Having selected Sayyid Mub&#257;rak for
the charge of the fort of Roht&#257;s, I conferred on him the mansab of
500 personal and 200 horse. On Thursday, the 14th, the camp was pitched
on the bank of the tank of the village of Sandh&#257;ra, and the feast
of cups was held, and chosen servants were made happy with cups of
pleasure. The birds of chase, &ldquo;that had been shut up in Agra to
moult&rdquo; (<i>ba-kur&#299;z basta b&#363;dand</i>), were this day
brought to me by K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, the
Chief Fowler. Picking out those that were fit for my own use, the rest
were given to the Am&#299;rs and other servants.</p>
<p class="par">On this day the news of the revolt and ingratitude for
favours of R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Mal, s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, came to my
ear. B&#257;so had several<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1750src" href=
"#xd24e1750" name="xd24e1750src">137</a> sons. Although the
above-mentioned was the eldest, his father mostly kept him in
confinement on account of his evil thoughts and mischievous tendencies,
and regarded him with displeasure. After his (B&#257;so&rsquo;s) death,
as this wretch was the eldest, and he had no other capable or
intelligent son, I, looking to the services rendered by R&#257;ja
B&#257;so, for the purpose of preserving the family of a Zamindar, and
the protection of his hereditary property and country, conferred on
this wretch the title of Raja, with a mansab of 2,000, and gave him the
position and jagir of his father, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"
href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>which the latter had obtained by
his loyalty and good service. I also gave him the sums of money and
goods that his father had collected during long years. When the
deceased Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. was sent off on the duty of conquering
K&#257;ng&#7771;a, as this wretch was the chief Zamindar of that hill
country, he outwardly displayed zeal in the service and loyalty, and
was nominated as an auxiliary. After he reached the spot,
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. pressed the siege tightly against the garrison.
This evil-minded fellow discovered from the appearance of things that
he would soon be victorious, and began to disagree and be troublesome.
He took off the veil of respect from his face, and proceeded to quarrel
and be hostile to Murtaz&#803;&#257; K.&rsquo;s men. Murtaz&#803;&#257;
K. read the writing of misery and ruin on the page of the
wretch&rsquo;s forehead, and reported unfavourably of him to the Court,
or rather wrote plainly that the signs of rebellion and want of loyalty
were clear in his conduct. As there was there such an officer as
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. and a large army in the hill-country, the wretch
did not find the time convenient for the preparation of a disturbance.
He sent a report to my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n that
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., at the instigation of interested parties, had
turned against him, and desired to overthrow and ruin him, and was
accusing him of wrong-doing and rebellion. He hoped that he would
summon him to Court, and thus provide a means for his escape and (the
prolonging of) his life. Although I had every confidence in the words
of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., yet as he (S&#363;raj Mal) begged to be sent
for to Court, a doubt passed into my mind that possibly
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., at the instigation of seditious people, might
cause a confusion, and might have accused him without due reflection.
Briefly, at the request of my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, passing
over his offence, I summoned him (S&#363;raj Mal) to Court. Just at
this time Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. died, and the conquest of the fort of
K&#257;ng&#7771;a was delayed till the dispatch of another leader. When
this seditious fellow arrived at Court, I, under the pressure of
affairs, rapidly encompassed him with favours and sent him off to do
duty with my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n in the conquest of the
Deccan. After this, when the Deccan had come into the possession of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>the servants of the enduring State, he, having
acquired influence in my son&rsquo;s service, was appointed to
superintend the taking of the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a. Although the
sending back of this ungrateful and untruthful one into that
hill-country showed a want of caution and care, yet as my son had taken
on himself the responsibility of the undertaking, I was obliged to give
in to his wish and to leave the matter to him. My fortunate son
appointed him, along with one of his own servants of the name of
Taq&#299; and a suitable army of <i>man&#7779;abd&#257;rs</i>,
<i>ah&#803;ad&#299;s</i>, and royal musketeers, as has already been
related summarily in these pages. When he arrived at the place, he
began to show enmity and trickery toward Taq&#299; also, and displayed
his natural disposition. He continually reported unfavourably of him
(Taq&#299;), until he wrote plainly that he could not get on with him,
and that Taq&#299; could not do the work. If another general were
appointed, the fort would be quickly conquered. In fine, he
(S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n) had no choice but to summon Taq&#299; to
Court, and to appoint R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, who was one of
his chief servants, with an army of fresh men on this service. When the
wretch discovered that his stratagems could no longer continue, and his
deceit go no farther, he, before the arrival of Bikram&#257;j&#299;t,
gave leave to a number of the servants of the Court, on the pretence
that they had been on service a long time without proper arrangements
(commissariat), to hasten to their jagirs and provide themselves with
their equipments before the arrival of R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t.
As palpably this came to a dispersion of the forces of the loyal, and
most of them left for their own jagirs, only a few experienced men
remained there. Seeing his opportunity, he showed the signs of revolt
and sedition. Sayyid &#7778;af&#299; B&#257;rha, who was distinguished
for his bravery, with some of his brothers and relatives, advanced the
feet of courage, and tasted the wholesome draught of martyrdom, and
some who were wounded with severe wounds, which are the adornment of
the lions of battle, that rascal took captive from the field of strife
and carried off to his own house of calamity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1764src" href="#xd24e1764" name="xd24e1764src">138</a> Some from
love<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1767src" href="#xd24e1767" name=

"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>themselves to the corner of safety. That rascal
stretched out the hand of oppression and possession over the parganas
on the skirts of the hill-country (<i>daman-i-k&#363;h</i>), which
mostly belonged to the jagir of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, and did not
abate a hair&rsquo;s breadth from attacking and plundering. It is hoped
that with the same swiftness, he will be caught with the reward of his
deeds and the recompense of his actions, and that the spirit<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e1781src" href="#xd24e1781" name=
"xd24e1781src">140</a> of this State will do its work, please God!</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 17th, I crossed Gh&#257;&#7789;&#299;
Ch&#257;n&#7693;&#257;. On Monday, the 18th, the J&#257;n-sip&#257;r
&#256;t&#257;l&#299;q K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n,
Commander-in-Chief, had the honour of kissing the threshold. As he had
been absent from my presence for a long time, and the victorious
retinue was passing by near the Sarkars of Khandesh and Burh&#257;npur,
he asked to wait upon me, and an order was given that if his mind were
at ease in all respects, he should come unattended and return quickly.
He accordingly came with all speed, and had the good fortune to pay his
respects on this day, and, having been exalted by the receipt of all
kinds of royal favours and kingly benefits, he presented an offering of
1,000 <i>muhars</i> and Rs. 1,000.</p>
<p class="par">As the camp had undergone great hardship in crossing the
Gh&#257;&#7789;&#299;, I ordered a halt for the refreshment of the
people on Tuesday, the 19th. I marched on Wednesday, the 20th, and on
Thursday, the 21st, halted again and held a feast of cups on the bank
of a river that is known as the Sind.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1793src" href="#xd24e1793" name="xd24e1793src">141</a> I gave a
special horse, of the name of Sumer, which was one of the finest
horses, to the K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. In the Hindi
language they call a hill of gold Sumer (Sumeru), and he was called by
this name on account of his colour and size. On Friday, the 22nd, and
Saturday, the 23rd, two successive marches were made. On this day a
wonderful waterfall was seen. The water is exceedingly clear, and pours
down with boiling and noise from a lofty place. On all sides of it
there are halting places <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>where one may praise God. Certainly I
have not recently seen such another fine waterfall, and it is a
delightful recreation-place. I was delighted with the spectacle for a
while. On Sunday, the 24th, I halted, and, sitting in a boat on a tank
which was in front of the royal enclosure
(<i>daulat-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>), were shot<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1801src" href="#xd24e1801" name="xd24e1801src">142</a> ducks
(<i>murg&#863;h&#257;b&#299;</i>). On Monday, the 25th, Tuesday, the
26th, and Wednesday, the 27th, I marched one after the other. I
bestowed on the K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n the
<i>p&#363;st&#299;n</i> (sheep-skin coat) I had on my own person, and
seven horses from my stable, on which I always rode, were also given
him. On Sunday, the 2nd of the Il&#257;h&#299; month of Dai, the royal
standards were raised at the fort of Ranthamb&#363;r. This is one of
the great forts of the Indians. In the time of Sult&#804;&#257;n
&#703;Al&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n K&#863;halj&#299;, R&#257;y Pitambar
Deo was in possession of it. The Sultan besieged it for a long time,
and conquered it with labour and great exertions, and in the
beginning<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1814src" href="#xd24e1814" name=
"xd24e1814src">143</a> of the reign of H.M. (Akbar)&mdash;may the light
of God be his witness!&mdash;R&#257;y Surjan H&#257;&#7693;&#257; had
it in his possession. He had always 6,000 or 7,000 horse in attendance
on him. That revered one, by the aid of the glorious God, conquered it
in the space of one month and twelve days, and R&#257;y Surjan, by the
guidance of fortune, having had the good fortune to kiss the threshold,
was enrolled among the number of the loyal, and became one of his
respectable and trusted Am&#299;rs. After him his son R&#257;y Bhoj
also was included among the great Am&#299;rs. Now his grandson,
Sar-buland R&#257;y, is among the chief officers. On Monday,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e1817src" href="#xd24e1817" name=
"xd24e1817src">144</a> the 3rd, I went to inspect the fort. There are
two hills close to each other. They call one Ran, and the other
Thanb&#363;r. The fort is built on the top of Thanb&#363;r, and,
putting these two names together, they have called it <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e1820" title=
"Source: Ranthanb&#363;r">Ranthamb&#363;r</span>. Although the fort is
exceedingly strong, and has plenty of water, the hill of Ran is a
specially strong fortress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>(in itself), and the capture of the
fortress depends upon the possession of this hill. Accordingly, my
revered father ordered that they should plant cannon on the top of the
hill of Ran, and aim at (<i>majr&#257; g&#299;rand</i>) the buildings
inside the fort. The first gun they fired reached the square building
(<i>chaukand&#299;</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1832src" href=
"#xd24e1832" name="xd24e1832src">145</a> of the palace of R&#257;y
Surjan. From the fall of that building, a trembling found its way into
the foundations of his courage, and a great perplexity overpowered his
heart, and thinking he would best consult his own safety in delivering
up the fort, he rubbed the head of worship and humility on the throne
of the king of kings, who forgave faults and accepted excuses.</p>
<p class="par">I had intended to pass the night in the fort, and the
next day to return to camp. As the buildings inside the fort had been
built after the fashion of the Hindus, and the rooms were without air
and with little space, they did not please me, nor was I disposed to
stay there. I saw a bath house, which one of the servants of
Dastam<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1840src" href="#xd24e1840" name=
"xd24e1840src">146</a> K&#863;h&#257;n had built near the wall of the
fort. A little garden and a lodging (<i>nis&#863;h&#299;man</i>) which
overlooks (<i>mus&#863;hrif</i>) the open space is not wanting in space
and air, and there is no better place in the whole fort.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e1849src" href="#xd24e1849" name=
"xd24e1849src">147</a> Dastam K. was one of the Am&#299;rs of the late
King (Akbar), and from his early years had been brought up in his
service. His connection with him was confidential and intimate. H.M.
had entrusted this fort to him from his exceeding confidence in
him.</p>
<p class="par">After completing my inspection of the fort and houses, I
ordered that they should bring before me the criminals who were
confined in the fort, so that I might look into the case of each of
them and give an order in accordance with justice. In brief, with the
exception of affairs of murder, and of any person through whose release
disturbance or calamity might ensue in the country, I freed them all,
and to each one in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span>accordance with his circumstances gave his
expenses and dresses<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1856src" href=
"#xd24e1856" name="xd24e1856src">148</a> of honour. On the eve of
Tuesday, the 4th, I returned to the royal abode after a watch and three
gharis had passed. On Sunday (properly Wednesday), the 5th, having
marched nearly 5 koss, I halted on Thursday, the 6th. On this day the
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n presented his offering of
jewels, ornamented vessels, cloth, and an elephant. Of these I chose
whatever pleased me, and returned the rest. What was accepted of his
offering was of the value of Rs. 150,000. On Friday, the 7th, I marched
5 koss. I had before this captured a <i>s&#257;ras</i> with a falcon,
but until now I had never seen the hunting of a
<i>durn&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e1869src" href="#xd24e1869"
name="xd24e1869src">149</a> (crane). As my son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n had great pleasure in <i>durn&#257;</i>
hunting with the falcon (<i>s&#863;h&#257;h&#299;n</i>), and his
falcons were well grown, at his request I rode out early in the
morning, and caught one <i>durn&#257;</i> myself, whilst the falcon my
son had on his wrist caught another. Certainly, of all good hunting
amusements, this is the best. I was exceedingly pleased with it.
Although the <i>s&#257;ras</i> is large, it is lazy and heavy on the
wing. The chase of the <i>durn&#257;</i> has no resemblance to it. I
praise the heart and courage of the falcon that can seize such
strong-bodied animals, and with the strength of his talons can subdue
them. H&#803;asan K., the chief <span class="corr" id="xd24e1893"
title="Source: hunstman">huntsman</span> of my son, was honoured with
an elephant, a horse, and a dress of honour, as a reward for this
exhibition of sport, and his son also received a horse and a dress of
honour. On Saturday, the 8th, having marched 4&frac14; koss, I halted
on Sunday, the 9th. On this day the
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, the Commander-in-Chief, having
raised the head of dignity through the gift of a special dress of
honour, a jewelled waist-sword, and a private elephant with trappings,
was reappointed to Khandesh and the Deccan. The mansab of that pillar
of the kingdom, original and increase, was fixed at 7,000 personal and
horse. As he did not get on with Las&#863;hkar K., at his request I
assigned to &#703;&#256;bid K. the duty of
D&#299;w&#257;n-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1896src" href="#xd24e1896" name="xd24e1896src">150</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>and having given him the mansab of 1,000 personal
and 400 horse, as well as a horse, an elephant, and a dress of honour,
sent him to that Subah. On the same day K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n
arrived from Kabul, and had the good fortune to pay his respects, and
presented as <i>naz&#817;r</i> 1,000 muhars and Rs. 1,000, as well as
an offering of a pearl rosary, fifty horses, ten Persian male and
female camels, and some hawks, and china,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1914src" href="#xd24e1914" name="xd24e1914src">151</a> and
porcelain (?), and other things. On Monday, the 10th, I marched
3&frac14; koss, and on Tuesday, the 11th, 5&frac34; koss. On this day
the K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n arranged his men before me, and passed
in review a thousand Mug&#863;hal cavalry, most of whom had Turk&#299;
horses, and some &#703;Ir&#257;q and some Mujannas<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e1917src" href="#xd24e1917" name="xd24e1917src">152</a> horses.
Though his troopers had been mostly dispersed, some going into the
service of Mah&#257;bat K. and remaining in that Subah, whilst a number
left him at Lahore and went into different parts of the dominion, yet
he could show this body of well-mounted men. Certainly the
K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n for valour and generalship is one of the
unique of the ages, but alas! I found he had become a decrepit old man,
and his sight was very weak. He has two intelligent young sons, who are
not wanting in reasonableness, but it will certainly be a great and
difficult thing for them to show themselves his equals. On this day I
gave him and his sons dresses of honour and swords. On Sunday, the
12th, traversing 3&frac12; koss, I alighted on the bank of the tank of
M&#257;nd&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1923src" href="#xd24e1923"
name="xd24e1923src">153</a> In the middle of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>tank
there is a stone building, and on one of the pillars the quatrain of
someone had been engraved. I saw it, and was amazed. In truth, it is a
fine verse:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My congenial friends have left me:</p>
<p class="line">One by one they&rsquo;ve fallen into the hands of
death.</p>
<p class="line">They were poor drinkers at the banquet of life.</p>

drunken.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1942src" href="#xd24e1942"
name="xd24e1942src">154</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par first">At this time I also heard another quatrain of the
same description, which I have recorded because it was very well
said:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Alas! that people of intelligence and wisdom
have passed away.</p>
<p class="line">They have been forgotten in the minds of their

<p class="line">Those who spoke with a hundred tongues</p>
<p class="line">Ah! what heard they that they became silent.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 13th, I made a halt.
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K., having come from Bangas&#863;h, had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Ikr&#257;m K., who was in
charge of the faujd&#257;ri of Fath&#803;p&#363;r and the
neighbourhood, was honoured with waiting on me. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K., Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; of the Deccan, was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=

M&#299;r H&#803;&#257;jj, who is one of the auxiliaries attached to
that Subah, and one of the brave young officers, was promoted to the
title of S&#863;harza (tiger-whelp) K., and received a standard. On
Friday, the 14th, I marched 5&frac14; koss. On Saturday, the 15th,
having marched 3 koss, I halted in the neighbourhood of
Bay&#257;n&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2005src" href="#xd24e2005"
name="xd24e2005src">155</a> There I hastened with the ladies to see the
spectacle of the top of the fort. Muh&#803;ammad, the
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; of Hum&#257;y&#363;n, who was entrusted with
the charge of the fort, had built a fine house overlooking the plain,
of great height and with fine air. The tomb of S&#863;haik&#863;h
Bahl&#363;l is also in that neighbourhood, and is not wanting in
excellence. The S&#863;haik&#863;h was the elder brother of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad G&#863;haus&#804;, and was much
versed in the science of incantations by names (of God).
Hum&#257;y&#363;n had great affection for him, and the most perfect
reliance on him. When he conquered the province of Bengal, he took up
his abode there for some time. M&#299;rz&#257; Hind&#257;l, by his
order, had remained<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2008src" href=
"#xd24e2008" name="xd24e2008src">156</a> at Agra. A body of avaricious
servants (<i>qulluq-chiy&#257;n</i>), whose character was mischievous
and seditious, taking to the way of faithlessness, came from Bengal to
the M&#299;rz&#257;, and, working upon his base nature (shaking the
chain of his vile heart), led the M&#299;rz&#257; on the road of
rebellion and ingratitude for favours, and of irrecognition of duty.
The thoughtless M&#299;rz&#257; had the <i>k&#863;hut&#804;ba</i>
recited in his own name (proclaimed himself king), and openly raised
the standard of rebellion and strife. When the royal ear heard what had
taken place from the reports of those who were loyal, he sent
S&#863;haik&#863;h Bahl&#363;l to admonish the M&#299;rz&#257;, and to
turn him back from his vain purpose, and to establish his feet on the
highroad of sincerity and concord. As these wretches had made
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>the flavour of royalty sweet to the
M&#299;rz&#257;&rsquo;s palate, he became imbued with futile ideas, and
would not be loyal. At the instigation of these seditious people he
made S&#863;haik&#863;h Bahl&#363;l a martyr with the sword of
recklessness at the Ch&#257;rb&#257;g&#863;h (garden) which H.M.
B&#257;bar had made on the bank of the Jumna. As Muh&#803;ammad
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; was a disciple of the S&#863;haik&#863;h, he
carried the body into the fort of Bay&#257;n&#257;, and buried it
there.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 16th, marching 4&frac12; koss, I came to
the stage of Barah.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2022src" href=
"#xd24e2022" name="xd24e2022src">157</a> As the garden and well which
had been built by the order of Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;
(Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s mother) in the pargana of J&#363;sat was on
the road, I went to inspect them. Certainly the
<i>b&#257;&#702;ol&#299;</i> (step-well) was a grand building, and had
been built exceedingly well. I ascertained from the officials that a
sum of Rs. 20,000 had been expended on this well. As there was much
game in this neighbourhood, I halted on Monday, the 17th.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 18th, marching 3&#8539; koss, the host
of prosperity halted at the village of
D&#257;yarm&#702;a&#702;&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2039src"

marching 2&frac12; koss, the victorious standards were raised on the
bank of the Lake of Fath&#803;p&#363;r. As at the time when the
conquest of the Deccan was meditated, the stages and distances from
Ranthamb&#363;r to Ujain were recorded, it appears unnecessary to
repeat them. From Ranthamb&#363;r<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2042src"

a distance of 234 koss, in sixty-three marches and fifty-six halts,
traversed in 119 days, or, according to solar reckoning, in one day
under four months, and by lunar four full months. From the date on
which the army of fortune started from the capital for the conquest of
the R&#257;n&#257; and the acquisition of the Deccan until now, when
the victorious and prosperous standards have been planted again in the
centre of the empire, it is five years and four months. The astrologers
and astronomers chose the day of <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i>
(Thursday), the 28th of the Divine month of Dai, in my thirteenth year,
corresponding with the last day of the Muh&#803;arram in the Hijr&#299;
year 1028 (January 7, 1619), as the proper time at which to enter the
capital of Agra.</p>
<p class="par">At this time, again, it appeared from the reports of the
loyal that the disease of the plague was prevalent in Agra, so that
daily about 100 people, more or less, were dying of it. Under the
armpits, or in the groin, or below the throat, buboes formed, and they
died. This is the third year that it has raged in the cold weather, and
disappeared in the commencement of the hot season. It is a strange
thing that in these three years the infection has spread to all the
towns and villages in the neighbourhood of Agra, while there has been
no trace of it at Fath&#803;p&#363;r. It has come as far as
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d, which is 2&frac12; koss from
Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and the people of that place
(Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d) have forsaken their homes and gone to other
villages. There being no choice, and considering the observance of
caution necessary, it was decided that at this propitious<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2055src" href="#xd24e2055" name=
"xd24e2055src">160</a> hour the victorious army should enter the
inhabited part of Fath&#803;p&#363;r in all joy and auspiciousness, and
after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>sickness and scarcity had subsided and another
auspicious hour had been chosen, I should enter the capital, please the
Almighty and most holy Allah!</p>
<p class="par">The Thursday entertainment took place on the bank of the
Lake of Fath&#803;p&#363;r. As the time for entering the town (of
Fath&#803;p&#363;r) was fixed for the 28th, I halted eight days in this
place. I ordered them to measure the circumference of the
lake,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2062src" href="#xd24e2062" name=
"xd24e2062src">161</a> and it came to 7 koss. At this stage, with the
exception of the revered Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299;, who had become very
weak, all the Begams and inhabitants of the enclosure of chastity and
all the palace employ&eacute;s came out to meet me (istiqb&#257;l). The
daughter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2065src" href="#xd24e2065" name=

s. K&#863;h&#257;n &#256;&#703;z&#804;am, told me a strange and
wonderful tale, and strongly insisted upon its truth. I write it on
account of its strangeness. She said: &ldquo;One day in the courtyard
of the house I saw a mouse rising and falling in a distracted state. It
was running about in every direction after the manner of drunkards, and
did not know where to go. I said to one of my girls: &lsquo;Take it by
the tail and throw it to the cat!&rsquo; The cat was delighted, and
jumped up from its place and seized it in its mouth, but immediately
dropped it and showed disgust. By degrees an expression of pain and
trouble showed itself in its face. The next day it was nearly dead,
when it entered into my mind to give it a little treacle<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2076src" href="#xd24e2076" name=
"xd24e2076src">163</a> (<i>tiry&#257;q</i>, opium?). When its mouth was
opened, the palate and tongue appeared black. It passed three days in a
state of misery, and on the fourth day came to its senses. After this
the grain (<i>d&#257;na</i>) of the plague (buboes) appeared in the
girl, and from excess of temperature and increase of pain she had no
rest. Her colour became changed&mdash;it was yellow inclining to
black&mdash;and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>fever was high (<i>tap muh&#803;riq
gard&#299;d</i>). The next day she vomited<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2093src" href="#xd24e2093" name="xd24e2093src">164</a> and had
motions, and died. Seven or eight people in that household died in the
same way, and so many were ill that I went to the garden from that
lodging. Those who were ill died in the garden, but in that place there
were no buboes. In brief, in the space of eight or nine days seventeen
people became travellers on the road of annihilation.&rdquo; She also
said: &ldquo;Those in whom the buboes appeared, if they called another
person for water to drink or wash in, the latter also caught the
infection (<i>sir&#257;yat</i>), and at last it came to such a pass
that through excessive apprehension no one would come near
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 22nd, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, who
had had the charge of Agra, having had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold, presented 500 <i>muhars</i> by way of <i>naz&#817;r</i>, and
Rs. 400<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2113src" href="#xd24e2113" name=

<p class="par xd24e2200">the royal standards auspiciously and happily

entertainment (of weighing) for my prosperous and noble son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, was held. I ordered him to be weighed
against gold and other things, and his twenty-eighth year according to
the solar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2202src" href="#xd24e2202" name=

may reach the natural<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2208src" href=

H.M. the revered Maryam-zam&#257;n&#299; (his mother) came from Agra,
and I acquired eternal good fortune from the blessing of waiting on
her. I hope that the shadow of her bringing up and affection may be
perennial on the head of this suppliant. As Ikr&#257;m K., s.
Isl&#257;m K., had performed the duties of faujd&#257;r of this
neighbourhood in a proper manner, I bestowed on him the mansab of 1,500
personal and 1,000 horse, original and increased. Suhr&#257;b<a class=

<p class="par">On this day, going over in detail the buildings of the
palace of the late King (Akbar), I showed them to my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n. Inside of them a large and very clear
reservoir of cut stone has been constructed, and is called the
<i>Kap&#363;r-tal&#257;o</i> (camphor tank). It is a square of 36 yards
by 36,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2219src" href="#xd24e2219" name=

order of that revered one, the officials of the public treasury had
filled it with <i>ful&#363;s</i> (copper coins) and rupees. It came to
34 krors, and 48 lakhs, and 46,000 d&#257;ms, and 1,679,400 rupees, or
a total of 10,300,000 (one kror and three lakhs) according to
Hindustani reckoning, and 343,000 <i>t&#363;m&#257;n</i> according to
Persian. For a long time the thirsty-lipped ones of the desert of
desire were satisfied from that fountain of benignity.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 1st Bahman, a reward of 1,000 <i>darb</i>
(Rs. 500) was given to H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; N&#257;d

To each of them, according to his condition, an allowance for living
had been granted. On this day they came from Agra, and had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold, and each of them was presented with Rs.
1,000. The <i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> entertainment was held in

copy (<i>jild</i>) of the <i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r-n&#257;ma</i>, together
with a special tipch&#257;q horse, were given to him to take to my son.
On Sunday, the 8th, Kunwar Karan, son of R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh, was
presented with a horse, an elephant, a dress of honour, a jewelled
<i>khapwa</i>, and a <i>ph&#363;l-ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i>. I gave him
leave to go to his jagir, and sent a horse with him for the
R&#257;n&#257;. On the same day I went out sporting to
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d. As there was an order that no one should kill
the antelope of that region, in the course of six years many antelope
had come together, and they had grown very tame. On Thursday, the 12th,
I returned to the palace, and on that day, according to custom, a feast
of cups was prepared.</p>
<p class="par">On the eve of Friday, the 13th (Bahman), I went to the
mausoleum of the refuge of pardon, S&#863;haik&#863;h Sal&#299;m
Chis&#863;ht&#299;, a little concerning whose blessed qualities has
been written in the preface<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2321src" href=
"#xd24e2321" name="xd24e2321src">175</a> to this record of prosperity,
and the <i>f&#257;tih&#803;a</i> was recited. Although the
manifestation of miracles and wonders is not approved by the elect of
the throne of God, and from humility and a feeling of their low rank
(as saints) they avoid such display, yet occasionally in the excitement
of ecstasy an appearance is manifested unintentionally and without
control,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2329src" href="#xd24e2329" name=
"xd24e2329src">176</a> or for the sake of teaching someone the
exhibition is made. Among these was this, that he before my birth gave
my father the good news of the advent of this suppliant and of my two
brothers. Again, one day my father incidentally asked him how old he
was, and when would he depart to the abiding regions. He replied:
&ldquo;The glorious God knows what is secret and hidden.&rdquo; After
much urgency he indicated this suppliant (Prince Sal&#299;m), and said:
&ldquo;When the Prince, by the instruction of a teacher or in any other
way, shall commit something to memory and shall recite it, this will be
a sign of my union with God.&rdquo; In consequence of this, His Majesty
gave strict orders to all who were in attendance on me that no one
should teach me anything in prose or verse. At length <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>when two
years and seven months had passed away, it happened one day that one of
the privileged<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2340src" href="#xd24e2340"
name="xd24e2340src">177</a> women was in the palace. She used to burn
rue constantly in order to avert the evil eye, and on this pretext had
access to me. She used to partake of the alms and charities. She found
me alone and regardless of (or ignorant of) what had been said (by
Akbar), she taught me this couplet:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O God, open the rosebud of hope</p>
<p class="line">Display a flower from the everlasting
garden.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2350src" href="#xd24e2350"

</div>
<p class="par first">I went to the S&#863;haik&#863;h and repeated this
couplet. He involuntarily rose up and hastened to wait on the King, and
informed him of what had occurred. In accordance with Fate, the same
night the traces of fever appeared, and the next day he sent someone to
the King (with the request) to call T&#257;n Sen Kal&#257;want, who was
unequalled as a singer. T&#257;n Sen, having gone to wait upon him,
began to sing. After this he sent some one to call the King. When H.M.
came, he said: &ldquo;The promised time of union has come, and I must
take leave of you.&rdquo; Taking his turban from his head, he placed it
on mine, and said: &ldquo;We have made Sult&#804;&#257;n Sal&#299;m our
successor, and have made him over to God, the protector and
preserver.&rdquo; Gradually his weakness increased, and the signs of
passing<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2354src" href="#xd24e2354" name=

with the &ldquo;True Beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">One of the greatest monuments of my father&rsquo;s reign
is this mosque and cemetery (<i>rauz&#803;a</i>). Certainly they are
exceedingly lofty and solid buildings. There is nothing like this
mosque in any other country. It is all built of beautiful stone, and
five lakhs of rupees were expended from the public treasury upon it.
Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K. Kokalt&#257;s&#863;h made the marble railing
(<i>mah&#803;jar</i>) round<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2366src" href=

(<i>fars&#863;h</i>) of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>dome and portico, and these are not
included in the five lakhs. The mosque has two great gateways. The
one<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2378src" href="#xd24e2378" name=
"xd24e2378src">181</a> towards the south is extremely lofty, and is
very beautiful. The archway (<i>p&#299;s&#863;ht&#257;q</i>) is 12
yards broad, 16 long, and 52 high. One must mount thirty-two steps to
get to the top of it. The other gateway is smaller, and is towards the
east. The length of the mosque from east to west, including the width
of the walls, is 212 yards. Out of this, the <i>Maq&#7779;&#363;ra</i>
(the chancel) is 25&frac12; yards, the middle is 15 yards by 15, the
portico (<i>p&#299;s&#863;ht&#257;q</i>) is 7 yards broad, 14 yards
long, and 25 yards high. On each side of the large dome are two smaller
domes 10 yards by 10. Then there is a veranda (<i>aiw&#257;n</i>) which
is pillared. The breadth of the mosque from north to south is 172
yards. Round it are ninety verandas (<i>aiw&#257;n</i>) and eighty-four
cells. The breadth of each cell is 4 yards,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2397src" href="#xd24e2397" name="xd24e2397src">182</a> and the
length 5 yards. The verandas are 7&frac12; yards broad. The courtyard
(<i>&#7779;ah&#803;n</i>) of the mosque, exclusive of the
<i>maq&#7779;&#363;ra</i>, and the verandas, and the gates, is 169
yards long and 143 yards broad. Above the verandas, the gates, and the
mosque, small domes have been constructed, and on the eves of
anniversaries and on holy days lamps are placed in these, and they are
enveloped in coloured<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2406src" href=
"#xd24e2406" name="xd24e2406src">183</a> cloths, so that they look like
lamp-shades (?). Under the courtyard they have made a well, and they
fill this with rainwater. As Fath&#803;p&#363;r has little water, and
what there is is bad, this well<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2415src"
href="#xd24e2415" name="xd24e2415src">184</a> yields a sufficient
supply for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=

Sal&#299;m Chis&#863;ht&#299;) and for the dervishes who are the
<i>muj&#257;wirs</i> (caretakers) of the mosque. Opposite the great
entrance and towards the north-north-east is the tomb of the
S&#863;haik&#863;h. The middle dome is 7 yards, and round the dome is a
portico of marble, and on the front side of this is a marble lattice.
It is very beautiful. Opposite this tomb on the west, at a little
distance, is another dome, in which are laid to rest the sons-in-law
and sons of the S&#863;haik&#863;h, such as Qut&#804;bu-d-d&#299;n K.,
Isl&#257;m K., Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K.,<a class="noteref" id=

others, who were all connected with this family, and rose to the
position of Amirs and to lofty rank. Accordingly, the circumstances of
each have been recorded in their places. At present the son of
Isl&#257;m K., who is distinguished by the title of Ikr&#257;m K., is
the lord of the prayer-carpet. The signs of auspiciousness are manifest
in him; I am much inclined to cherish him.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 19th, I promoted

I bestowed on him an elephant, a horse, and a dress of honour.
Turs&#363;n Bah&#257;dur was also dispatched on this duty, and his
mansab was fixed at 1,200 personal and 450 horse. He was given a horse,
and took his leave. As the house of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula was on
the bank of a tank, and people praised it greatly as a delightful place
and enchanting residence, at his request on Thursday, the 26th, an
entertainment was held there. That pillar of the kingdom engaged in the
dues of prostration and offerings, and prepared a grand meeting. At
night, after eating food, I returned to the palace. On Thursday, the

&#703;Abdu-l-Wahh&#257;b B&#257;rha, who had done active service in
Gujarat, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse,

"pb74">74</a>]</span>employed myself in the pleasure of hunting. On the
eve of Thursday, the 27th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2434src" href=
"#xd24e2434" name="xd24e2434src">186</a> (17th), I returned to the
palace.</p>
<p class="par">By chance, on Tuesday, during the hunting, a string of
pearls and rubies that N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n Begam had on her neck was
broken, and a ruby of the value of Rs. 10,000 and a pearl worth Rs.
1,000 were lost. Although the huntsmen made every search for it on
Wednesday, it did not fall into their hands. It occurred to me that as
the name of the day was <i>Kam-s&#863;hamba</i>, it was impossible to
find it on that day. On the contrary, as
<i>Mub&#257;rak-s&#863;hamba</i> (Thursday) was always a lucky day for
me, and had been blessed to me, the huntsmen on that day with but a
little search found both in that track-less place (without head or
foundation) and brought them to me. The best of coincidences was that
on the same propitious day the entertainment for my lunar weighing and
the feast of Basant-b&#257;r&#299; (Spring festival) also took place,
and the good news of the conquest of the fort of Mau and the defeat of
that evil-fortuned S&#363;raj Mal arrived.</p>
<p class="par">The particulars of this are that when R&#257;ja
Bikram&#257;j&#299;t with the victorious army arrived in that region,
the ill-fated S&#363;raj Mal desired to delay him for some days by
trickery and babblement, but the aforesaid knew the real state of the
case and did not pay attention to his words, but advanced with the foot
of valour. That abandoned one, letting fall from his hand the thread of
plan, neither planted the foot of intrepidity firmly for battle nor had
the courage to defend the fort. After a slight struggle, and when many
of his people had been slaughtered, he took to flight, and the forts of
Mau<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2447src" href="#xd24e2447" name=
"xd24e2447src">187</a> and Mahr&#299; (?), which were the chief
reliance of that ill-fated man, were both taken without difficulty. A
country <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>which he had held by hereditary right from his
fathers was trodden under foot by the victorious troops, and he became
a wanderer and a vagabond. He retired to the ravines of the hills, and
cast the dust of ruin and contempt on the head of his Fortune.
R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, leaving his country behind, hastened in
pursuit of him with the victorious army. When the state of affairs
reached the royal ears, in reward for this becoming service I ordered
drums for the Raja, and a fateful farman was issued from the Sovereign
of Wrath that they should overthrow from their foundation the fort and
buildings that had been erected by S&#363;raj Mal&rsquo;s father and
himself, and leave not a trace of them on the face of the earth. A
strange thing is that the unfortunate S&#363;raj Mal had a brother
called Jagat Singh. When I promoted S&#363;raj Mal to the title of
Raja, and made him an Amir, and gave him dominion, etc., without a
partner or sharer, I, in order to please him, gave a small mansab to
Jagat Singh, who did not get on well with him, and sent him to Bengal.
This wretched one was passing his days in a poor condition far from his
home, in contempt, and to the delight of his enemies, and waiting for
some hidden aid, until by his good fortune this affair took place, and
that unblessed one struck an axe on his own foot. Summoning Jagat Singh
in all haste to Court, I honoured him with the title of Raja and the
mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and bestowed 20,000
<i>darbs</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e2460src" href="#xd24e2460"
name="xd24e2460src">188</a> on him out of the public treasury for his
expenses. Giving him a jewelled khapwa, a robe of honour, a horse, and
an elephant, I sent him to R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, and issued a
farman that if the aforesaid, by the guidance of a good destiny, should
perform laudable service, and display loyalty, that country should be
given over into his hand.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2466src" href=
"#xd24e2466" name="xd24e2466src">189</a></p>
<p class="par">As the praise of the garden of N&#363;r-manzil and the
buildings that had been newly-erected there continually reached me, I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>on Monday mounted my steed, and went to the stage
of Bust&#257;n-sar&#257;y, and passed Tuesday in pleasure and at ease
in that entrancing rose-garden. On the eve of Wednesday the garden of
N&#363;r-manzil (the abode of light) was adorned by the alighting of
the hosts of prosperity. This garden contains 330 <i>jar&#299;bs</i>
(<i>b&#299;gh&#257;s</i>), according to the <i>Il&#257;h&#299; gaz</i>.
Around it there has been built a wall, lofty and broad, of bricks and
cement, exceedingly strong. In the garden there is a lofty building and
a residence, highly decorated. Pleasant reservoirs have been
constructed, and outside the gate a large well has been made, from
which thirty-two pairs of bullocks continually draw water. The canal
passes through the garden, and pours water into the reservoirs. Besides
this, there are other wells, the water of which is distributed to the
reservoirs and plots. The beauty is increased by all kinds of fountains
and cascades and there is a tank in the exact middle of the garden
which is filled by rainwater. If by chance its water should fail in the
extreme heat, they supplement it by water from the wells, so that it
may always be full to the brim. Nearly Rs. 150,000 have been spent up
to now on this garden, and it is still unfinished, and large sums will
be expended in making avenues and laying down plants. It has also been
settled that the middle garden shall be newly walled<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e2482src" href="#xd24e2482" name="xd24e2482src">190</a> round,
and the channels for the coming and going of the water shall be made so
strong that it may always remain full of water and the water shall not
leak out in any way, and no damage accrue. It is possible that before
it is complete nearly Rs. 200,000 will have been spent on it.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 24th, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n
presented an offering of jewels, jewelled vessels, cloths, an elephant,
and a horse, of the value of Rs. 150,000. Having made a selection from
them, I gave him the remainder. Until Saturday I passed my time in that
garden of delight in enjoyment. On the eve of Sunday, the 27th, I
inclined the reins of returning towards <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and
an order was given that the great Amirs, according to annual custom,
should decorate the palace. On Monday, the 28th, I found that something
had gone wrong with my eye. As it arose from too much blood, I ordered
&#703;Al&#299; Akbar, the surgeon, to open a vein. On the next day the
benefit of this was apparent. I bestowed Rs. 1,000 on him. On Tuesday,
the 29th, Muqarrab K. came from his native place, and had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold, and I favoured him with many sorts of
kindness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=

his ill-health prevented him. It is also the fact that orthodox
Muhammadans object to translations of the Qoran, regarding it as an
impossible task. The M&#299;r&rsquo;s son became chief ecclesiastical

which Sadi, who cites it with applause, pours blessings on his departed

called Barmadh Mata. In the 7th year of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, 1022, 1613,

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r says four <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> are nearly
equal to two sidereal hours. According to Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l, a
<i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> is the sixteenth part of a nychthemeron,
or 360 out of the 21,600 breathings which make up a
nychthemeron&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, 24 hours. See Jarrett, III. 16 and 17,
and II. 16, n. 4. According to the Bah&#257;r-i-&#703;ajam, 2&frac12;
<i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> = one sidereal hour, so that, correctly
speaking, five <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> = two sidereal hours. Each
<i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> is 24 minutes (Jarrett, II. 16, n. 4).
Here it should be noted that there is a mistake in the translation at
p. 17, line 2, of Jarrett, vol. III., due to a faulty reading in the
Bib. Ind. edition of the text. Instead of <i>yak&#299;</i> we should
read <i>pal&#299;</i>, as in two MSS. in my possession.
Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l&rsquo;s meaning then becomes clear. What he says
is, a <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> is 360 breathings, consequently
(<i>pas</i>) every <i>pal</i> (already defined as the sixtieth part of
a <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i>) is 360 divided by 60, and equal to six
breathings (<i>nafas</i>). Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s line, however, is
obscure. In two I.O. MSS. we have <i>ba-t&#804;&#257;la&#703;&#299;</i>
instead of <i>ba-s&#257;&#703;at&#299;</i>. I think the meaning
probably is that the same day which marked Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s
arrival at Fath&#803;p&#363;r also marked
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p class="par footnote cont"><i>Tawall&#257;</i> is defined in the
Bah&#257;r-i-&#703;ajam as meaning to have friendship with anyone. It
also says that it is used in the sense of

Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s line means &ldquo;At a moment which nearly
corresponded to two (hours).&rdquo; <i>Taqw&#299;m</i> would then mean

Vol. XVIII., for 1894, yards seem to be required here, for the tank is
mentioned in the Report as being 95 feet 7 inches square. According to
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, 34 krors odd of dams&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, I presume,
<i>ful&#363;s</i>, in copper money, and 16 lakhs and 80,000 rupees in
silver were poured into the tank, making a total of 1 kror and 3 lakhs
of rupees, or 3 lakhs 43,000 <i>t&#363;m&#257;ns</i>. Apparently the
<i>t&#363;m&#257;n</i>, which was a gold coin, was, in
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s time, reckoned as worth 30 rupees, and
Wollaston, in his Dictionary, says it was worth &pound;3 in
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s I.&rsquo;s time.
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s account of the tank should be compared with
that given in the Akbar-n&#257;ma, III. 246 and 257, where the tank is
called the An&#363;p-tal&#257;o, or the &ldquo;Unequalled
Tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">In the text, difficulty has, I think, been
made by the introduction of the word <i>kih</i> in p. 260, six lines
from foot, and <i>b&#257;s&#863;had</i> in the fifth line from the
foot. These words make the sense to be that 34 krors odd of dams were
only equal to 16 <span class="corr" id="xd24e2260" title=
"Source: lahks">lakhs</span> odd of rupees. But this cannot be, for the
dam was the fortieth part of a rupee, and so 34 krors of dams would be
not far short of one kror&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, 100 lakhs of rupees. The
MSS. have not the <i>kih</i> and <i>b&#257;s&#863;had</i> in question,
and have only a conjunction after the word <i>d&#257;m</i>. Thirty-four
krors odd of copper and 16 lakhs of silver were poured into the tank,
making a total, in round numbers, of 1 kror, 3 lakhs of rupees.
According to Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l gold was also thrown
in.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd24e2219src">&uarr;</a></p>

<h2 class="main">The Fourteenth New Year&rsquo;s Feast from the
Auspicious Accession</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the morning of Thursday, the 4th of the month
of Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir, Hijr&#299; 1028 (March 10,
1619), the world-enlightening sun entered his house of honour in Aries,
and the fourteenth year of the reign of this suppliant commenced in all
prosperity and happiness. On Thursday, the 1st of the New Year, my
prosperous son, S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, who is the star of the
forehead of accomplished desires, and the brilliancy of the brow of
prosperity, prepared a grand entertainment, and presented me as
offerings with a selection of the precious things of the age, and
rareties and curiosities of every country. One of these is a ruby,
weighing 22 <i>surk&#863;hs</i>, of good colour, and water, and shape.
The jewellers have valued it at Rs. 40,000. Another is a
<i>Qut&#804;b&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e2509src" href=
"#xd24e2509" name="xd24e2509src">1</a> (?) ruby, in weight 3
<i>t&#257;nks</i>, and very delicate, valued at Rs. 40,000. Further,
six pearls, one of them 1 <i>t&#257;nk</i> and 8 <i>surk&#863;hs</i> in
weight. The Vakils of my son had bought it in Gujarat for Rs. 25,000,
and the five others for Rs. 33,000. Also one diamond, the price of
which was Rs. 18,000. Also a jewelled <i>parda</i> (sash), a sword-hilt
made in his own goldsmith&rsquo;s shop; most of the jewels he had
himself set and cut. He had brought great dexterity to bear on the
design. Its value was fixed as Rs. 50,000. The designs<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2525src" href="#xd24e2525" name="xd24e2525src">2</a>
were his own; no one else had up to this day thought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>of them.
Undoubtedly it was a fine piece of workmanship. There was also a pair
of drums made of gold for playing the <i>mursal</i> (overture?) with a
whole orchestra&mdash;viz., <i>kuwarga</i>, <i>naqq&#257;ra</i>,
<i>karan&#257;</i>, <i>surn&#257;</i>, etc.&mdash;whatever was required
for the <i>naqq&#257;ra-kh&#257;na</i> (music-hall) of great princes,
and all made of silver. At the auspicious hour at which I had seated
myself on the throne of success these were all sounded. The whole of
them came to a value of Rs. 65,000. Another was a seat for riding an
elephant, called by moderns a howdah (<i>hauda</i>), made of gold,
worth Rs. 30,000. Beside this there were two large elephants and five
elephant-trappings of the offerings of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, ruler of
Golconda. The first elephant was named D&#257;d-i-Il&#257;h&#299; (the
gift of God). As it entered the private elephant-house on New
Year&rsquo;s Day, I gave it the name of <i>N&#363;r-i-Naur&#363;z</i>
(the Light of New Year&rsquo;s Day). In truth he is a grand elephant,
and lacks nothing of size, beauty, and dignity. As he looked well to my
eye, I mounted him and rode him into the courtyard of the palace. His
value was fixed at Rs. 80,000, and the value of six<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e2582src" href="#xd24e2582" name="xd24e2582src">3</a> others at
Rs. 20,000. Its golden trappings, consisting of golden chains, etc., my
son had had made for the elephant N&#363;r-i-Naur&#363;z, were worth
Rs. 30,000. The second elephant, with silver housings, was also
presented, with Rs. 10,000 more in various choice jewels. The
<i>kurkar&#257;qs</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e2588src" href=
"#xd24e2588" name="xd24e2588src">4</a> of my son had also prepared and
sent delicate cloths from Gujarat. If all details were to be written,
it would take too long. Briefly, the whole of his offerings was of the
value of Rs. 450,000. It is hoped that he will eat the fruit of long
life and prosperity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"

<p class="par">On Friday, the 2nd, S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K.
&#703;Arab, and N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299;, the kotwal, laid their
offerings before me. On Saturday, the 3rd, D&#257;r&#257;b K., son of
the K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, and on Sunday, the 4th,
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, prayed to be allowed to entertain me. Out
of the latter&rsquo;s offerings I accepted one pearl, bought for Rs.
20,000, with other rareties, altogether of the value of Rs. 130,000,
and presented him with the rest. On Monday, the 5th, R&#257;ja
Kis&#863;han D&#257;s and H&#803;ak&#299;m K., on Tuesday, the 6th,
Sard&#257;r K., and on Wednesday, the 7th, Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; K.
and Am&#257;nat K., presented their offerings. From each of these I
took a trifle in order to dignify them. On Thursday, the 8th,
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, <i>Mad&#257;r-ul-mulk</i> (the pivot of the
country), having prepared a royal entertainment, begged to be allowed
to receive me. In accepting this request his standing was raised. In
fact, in decorating the assembly and the largeness of his offering, he
had exceeded himself, and made many decorations, and illuminated all
sides of the lake as far as the eye could reach, and decorated the
streets both near and far with all kinds of lights and coloured
lanterns. Among the offerings of that <i>Mad&#257;r-us-saltana</i>
there was a throne of gold and silver, much ornamented and decorated,
the supports of which were in the form of tigers. It had been completed
with great assiduity in the space of three years, and was made at the
cost of Rs. 450,000. This throne had been made by a skilful European of
the name of Hunarmand (skilful), who had no rival in the arts of a
goldsmith and a jeweller, and in all sorts of skill
(<i>hunarmand&#299;</i>). He had made it very well, and I gave him this
name. In addition to the offerings he had brought for me, he offered
the value of Rs. 100,000 in jewelled ornaments and cloths to the Begams
and other ladies of the Palace. Without exaggeration, from the
beginning of the reign of the late king (may the light of Allah be his
testimony!) until now, which is the fourteenth year of the rule of this
suppliant, not one of the great Amirs has presented such offerings. In
fact, what comparison is there between him and others?</p>
<p class="par">On this day Ikr&#257;m K., s. Isl&#257;m K. was honoured
with the mansab, original and increased, of 2,000 personal and 1,000
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=

with that of 2,000 personal and 1,600 horse, original and increased. On
Friday, the 9th, I&#703;tib&#257;r K. presented his offering, and on
the same day K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, having been presented with a
horse and an elephant, took leave to go to the government of
Patna.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2618src" href="#xd24e2618" name=
"xd24e2618src">5</a> His mansab, according to a previous rule, was
fixed at 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. On Saturday, the 10th,
F&#257;z&#803;il K., on Sunday, the 11th, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, on
Monday, the 12th, I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. on Tuesday, the 13th,
T&#257;t&#257;r K. and An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan, and on
Wednesday, the 14th, M&#299;rz&#257; R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh,
presented their offerings. Selecting from them what was delicate and
new, I gave the remainder to them. On Thursday, the 15th,
&#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n prepared a grand assembly and a royal
entertainment in his own house, which is a very fine and pleasant
place, and begged to be allowed to receive me. At his request, giving
him the dignity of acceptance, I went there with the ladies. That
pillar of the kingdom looked on this as a bounty from the secret Giver,
and in the increase of his offering and preparation of the
entertainment displayed great magnificence. Of jewels of great price
and delicate gold brocades and all sorts of gifts, that which was
approved was selected, and I presented him with the remainder. Among
the offerings was a ruby weighing 12&frac12; <i>t&#257;nks</i>, which
was bought for Rs. 125,000. The value of the offerings that were
accepted was Rs. 167,000. On this day K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n was
raised to the mansab of 5,000 personal and 2,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">Las&#863;hkar K., having come, by order, from the
Deccan, had the honour of waiting on me. As I had determined, after the
rainy season had passed and in the beginning of the good weather, to go
to the perpetual spring garden of Kashm&#299;r under the favour of
Almighty God, it seemed right to me that the guardianship and
administration of the fort and city of Agra and the faujd&#257;rship of
the district, after the manner in which they had been held by
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, should be entrusted to Las&#863;hkar K.,
and I honoured him with the good news. Am&#257;nat K. was entrusted
with the duty of superintendent of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82"

I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula was promoted to that of 7,000 personal and
horse. I selected &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula for the duty of tutor to
the pupil of the eye of the Sultanate, S&#863;h&#257;h
S&#863;huj&#257;&#703;. I hope that he (the latter) may endure for his
natural term of life and may be one of the prosperous ones. Q&#257;sim
K. was raised to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 500 horse, and
B&#257;qir K. to that of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. As Mah&#257;bat
K. had asked for reinforcements, I appointed 500
<i>Ah&#803;ad&#299;</i> horse to Bangash, and presented &#703;Izzat K.,
who had done approved service in that province, with a horse and a
jewelled <i>khapwa</i>. At this time &#703;Abdu-s-Satt&#257;r<a class=

presented as an offering a compendium in the handwriting of the late
king Hum&#257;y&#363;n (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!),
containing some prayers, an introduction to the science of astronomy,
and other marvellous things, most of which he had studied and carried
into practice. After reverently inspecting his auspicious handwriting,
I felt a joy such as I had seldom experienced. I was exceedingly
rejoiced, for, by God, no precious thing I have can be compared with
this. In return I increased his mansab beyond what he had imagined
possible, and gave him a present of Rs. 1,000. Hunarmand, the European
who had made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=

<i>darb</i>, a horse and an elephant. I gave Rs. 1,000 to
K&#863;hw&#257;ja K&#863;h&#257;wand Mah&#803;m&#363;d, who is a
pilgrim of the Path of the K&#863;hw&#257;jas, and is not void of
dervishism and spirituality. Las&#863;hkar K. was promoted to the
mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, Ma&#703;m&#363;r K. to that
of 900 personal and 450 horse, Khw&#257;jag&#299; T&#804;&#257;hir to
that of 800 personal and 300 horse, and Sayyid Ah&#803;mad
Q&#257;dir&#299; to that of 800 and 60 horse. On R&#257;ja S&#257;rang
Deo was conferred the mansab of 700 personal and 30 horse, on M&#299;r
K&#863;hal&#299;l-u-llah, s. &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula, that of 600

superintendent of the Palace, that of 600 personal and 100 horse, on
Nathmal and Jagmal, sons of Kis&#863;han Singh, that of 500 and 225
horse each. If the increase of mansab given to those of less than 500
were to be written in full it would be too long. Rs. 2,000 were given
to K&#863;hiz&#803;r K., who belonged<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 21st, I went to
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d for the purpose of sport. Some days before
this, in accordance with orders, K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, and
Qiy&#257;m K., the head huntsman, had chosen a wide plain for a
<i>qamarg&#863;ha</i> hunt, and drawn an enclosure round it, and driven
within it many antelope from the neighbouring plains. As I had vowed
that I would hereafter not kill any living thing with my own hand, it
occurred to me to take them all alive, and place them within the
Chaug&#257;n (polo-ground) of Fath&#803;p&#363;r, so that I might both
enjoy the pleasure of sport and that at the same time no harm should
happen to them. I accordingly took 700 head and sent them to
Fath&#803;p&#363;r. As the hour for entering the capital was near, I
ordered R&#257;y M&#257;n, <i>k&#863;hidmatiyya</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e2683src" href="#xd24e2683" name="xd24e2683src">10</a> to put
up a screen on two sides, like a lane, from the hunting-place
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>to the plain of Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and to drive
the antelope there. About 800 antelope were sent in this way, or
altogether 1,500. On the night of Wednesday, the 28th, marching from
Am&#257;n&#257;b&#257;d, I halted in B&#363;st&#257;n Sar&#257;y, and
on the eve of Thursday, the 29th, I halted at the N&#363;r-manzil
garden.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 30th, the mother<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2693src" href="#xd24e2693" name="xd24e2693src">11</a> of
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n attained the mercy of God. The next day I
myself went to the house of that precious son, and having condoled with
him in every way, took him with me to the palace. On Sunday, the 1st
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, at the auspicious hour chosen by the
astrologers and astronomers, I mounted a special elephant of the name
of Dil&#299;r, and in all prosperity and happiness entered the city. A
great crowd of people, men and women, had collected together in the
streets and bazaars, and at the gates and walls, expecting me.
According to custom, I went on, scattering money on the way, to inside
the palace. From the date on which the army of prosperity started for
this happily terminated journey until now, when I returned in happiness
and good fortune, it was five years, seven months, and nine days. At
this time I ordered my son Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z that, as a
long time had passed during which he had been deprived of waiting on me
personally, or had been fortunate enough to pay his respects, if he
were desirous of meeting me, he should come to Court. On the arrival of
the gracious farm&#257;n, that son, considering the manifestation of
this favour a gift from the hidden world, turned the face of his hope
towards the sphere-resembling Court. At this time I gave away, as a
means of livelihood, to Faqirs and deserving people 44,786 bighas of
land, and two entire villages, with 320 ass-loads
(<i>k&#863;harw&#257;r</i>, a weight) of grain from Kashmir, and seven
ploughs<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2699src" href="#xd24e2699" name=

Bestower of desires and benevolence may be their daily lot.

<p class="par">One of the occurrences of this time is the revolt of
All&#257;hd&#257;d, son of Jal&#257;l, the Afghan. The details of this
are that when Mah&#257;bat K. obtained leave to go and take possession
of Bangash and overthrow the Afghans, from an idea that that wretch
would do some service in return for the favours and kindness I had
conferred on him, he prayed that he might take him with him. As the
natural tendency of such ungrateful men who do not recognize what is
right, tends to enmity and malevolence, by way of precaution it was
decided to send his son and brother to the Court that they might be as
hostages. After the arrival there of his son and brother, I, by way of
comforting them, did them all kinds of kindness, but, as they have
said:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The blanket of fortune of anyone that has been
woven black</p>
<p class="line">Cannot be whitened even by the waters of Zamzam and
Kaus&#804;ar.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">From the day on which he arrived in that country
the signs of rascality and want of recognition of the right began to be
apparent on the cheeks of his affairs, and Mah&#257;bat K., in order to
control matters, did not loose from his hand the rope of forbearance
until, at this time, he sent a force under the leadership of his son
against a band of Afghans, and sent All&#257;hd&#257;d with him. When
they reached the purposed place, from the enmity and malevolence of the
aforesaid, that attack did not <span class="corr" id="xd24e2714" title=
"Source: succceed">succeed</span>, and they returned with their aim
uncompleted. The evil-dispositioned All&#257;hd&#257;d, from a
suspicion lest this time Mah&#257;bat K. should abandon his method of
conciliation, and ascertain the real state of affairs, and that he
should be caught in recompense for his evil deeds, lifted up the veil
of reverence, and betrayed involuntarily the faithlessness to his salt,
which he had till then concealed. When I heard from Mah&#257;bat
K.&rsquo;s letter the true state of affairs, I ordered them to imprison
his son and brother in the fort of Gwalior. As it had happened
(Jal&#257;l T&#257;r&#299;k&#299;), the father of this wretch had also
fled from the service of the late king, and for years passed his time
in thieving and highway robbery, until he was caught in the recompense
of his own evil deeds. It is hoped that this rascal will also soon
obtain the reward of his bad actions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">On Thursday, the 5th, M&#257;n Singh, s. R&#257;wat
S&#863;hankar, who was one of the auxiliaries of Bihar, was promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600 horse. I sent off &#703;&#256;qil
K. to look after the cavalry,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2720src" href=
"#xd24e2720" name="xd24e2720src">13</a> and inquire into the corps of
the mansabdars who had been appointed for duty in Bangash, and gave him
an elephant. I sent as a gift to Mah&#257;bat K. a private dagger made
after the M&#257;zandar&#257;n fashion, along with D&#363;st Beg. The
offering of Monday was given as a present to Mah&#803;m&#363;d
&#256;b-d&#257;r, who from the time when I was a prince and the days of
my childhood had served me. M&#299;r&#257;n (not B&#299;zan,<a class=

P&#257;yanda K. Moghul, was promoted to the mansab of 700 personal and
450 horse. Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, brother of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Jah&#257;n, who was Bakhshi of K&#257;ng&#7771;a, was promoted to the
mansab of 600 personal and 450 horse. On this day Tarbiyat K., who is
one of the hereditary houseborn ones of this Court, and had been
enrolled among the Amirs by reason<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2728src"
href="#xd24e2728" name="xd24e2728src">15</a> of his good disposition,
died. He was not devoid of sluggishness
(<i>n&#257;-mur&#257;d&#299;</i>, literally want of desires) and
self-indulgence (<i>sal&#257;mat-i-nafs</i>), and was a young man fond
of pleasure (<i>&#703;ayy&#257;s&#863;h-&#7789;ab&#299;&#703;at</i>).
He wished to pass his whole life at ease, and was devoted to Hindu
music and did not understand it badly. He was a man void of evil.
R&#257;ja S&#363;raj Singh was raised to the mansab of 2,000 personal
and horse. To Karamu-llah, s. &#703;Al&#299; Mard&#257;n K.
Bah&#257;dur, B&#257;qir K., Faujd&#257;r of Multan, Malik Muh&#803;ibb

B&#257;yaz&#299;d Bhakkar&#299;, to whom was entrusted the charge of
the fort of Bhakkar and the faujd&#257;rship of that region, was also
honoured with an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=

distinguished with the gift of a jewelled dagger. I gave elephants to
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad H&#257;ns&#299;, S&#863;haik&#863;h
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f Sambhal&#299;, the eunuch Fir&#257;sat

S&#863;haf&#299;&#703; Bakhshi of the Panjab, was raised to the mansab
of 500 personal and 300 horse. The mansab of 500 personal and 150 horse
was conferred on M&#363;nis, s. Mihtar<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">On this day arrived the news of the death of
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K. s. the Commander-in-Chief K&#863;h&#257;n
K&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. It was the cause of distress of mind to me. At
the time when that &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q (K&#863;h&#257;n
K&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n) took leave from waiting on me, it had been
strictly impressed upon him that, as it had been repeatedly brought to
my ear that S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K. had been maddened with wine
and drank immoderately, if there was truth in this it was a pity that
he should destroy himself at his age. It was necessary that he should
not leave him to his own way, but look after his case properly. If he
could not leave his charge himself, he should write a clear report, so
that, having summoned him into my presence, I might give the best order
practicable under the circumstances. When he arrived at Burhanpur,
having found S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K&#863;h&#257;n very weak and
low, he tried to make some remedy for him. After some days&rsquo;
confinement to bed (literally, lord of the carpet) he fell on the couch
of powerlessness. Whatever remedies and plans the physicians employed
were of no avail, and in the best time of his youth and prosperity, in
the thirty-third year of his age, to the sorrow and grief of the world,
he went to the place of the mercy and pardon of God. On hearing this
unpleasant news I was greatly grieved, for in truth he was an
intelligent youth and born in the house. He would have performed
important services in this State, and left great traces behind him.
Although this road is before all and there is no escape for anyone out
of the command of destiny, yet it appears sad to depart in this
fashion. It is hoped he will be among those who are pardoned. I sent
R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo, who was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>one of my close attendants and
is a tactful person, to the &#256;t&#257;l&#299;q, and favoured and
consoled him in every way. The mansab of 5,000 held by
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z I added on to those of his brothers and
sons. To D&#257;r&#257;b, his younger brother, I gave the mansab of
5,000 personal, original and increased, and presented him with a dress
of honour, an elephant, a horse, and a jewelled sword, and gave him
leave to go to his father to fill, in place of
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z, the post of governor of Berar and
Ahmadnagar. Rah&#803;m&#257;n-d&#257;d, another brother, I promoted to
the mansab of 2,000 and 800 horse. Man&#363;chahr, s.
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z, was given the mansab of 2,000 personal and
1,000 horse. T&#804;ag&#863;hzal (Tog&#863;hril?), s.
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2751src" href=
"#xd24e2751" name="xd24e2751src">17</a> K. was promoted to the mansab
of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On Thursday, the 12th, Q&#257;sim K.,
son-in-law of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, was honoured with the favour
of a standard. Asadu-llah, s. Sayyid H&#803;&#257;j&#299;, who had come
with the intention of obtaining service, had the mansab bestowed on him
of 500 personal and 100 horse. &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, son-in-law of the
deceased Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., received that of 700 personal and 600
horse, and was appointed to the faujd&#257;rship of Sambhal, and,
having had an elephant bestowed on him, I gave him leave. Bh&#257;rat
Band&#299;la was also presented with the mansab of 600 personal and 400
horse, and had an elephant given him, and an elephant was bestowed on
Sangr&#257;m, the Raja of Jammu.</p>
<p class="par">In Ahmadabad I had two male
<i>m&#257;rk&#863;h&#363;r</i> goats. As I had not a female in my
establishment to pair with them, it occurred to me that if I could pair
them with Barbary goats, which they bring from Arabia, especially from
the port of the city of Darkhar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2759src"
href="#xd24e2759" name="xd24e2759src">18</a> young of their form and
qualities might be obtained. In short, I paired them with seven Barbary
ewes, and after six months had elapsed each of the latter had a young
one at Fath&#803;p&#363;r: there were four females and three males,
very pleasing in appearance, of good shape and good colour. In their
colour, those (kids) which resembled the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>male (<i>taka</i>, not
<i>baka</i>, as in the printed copy) were dun-coloured with black
stripes on their backs. Red,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2774src" href=
"#xd24e2774" name="xd24e2774src">19</a> indeed, appears to me a more
pleasing colour than any other, and it is the mark of a better breed.
Of their liveliness and laughable ways and their manner of gamboling
and leaping, what can be written? Some of their ways are such that the
mind derived uncontrolled pleasure from looking at them. It is
notorious that painters cannot draw properly the motions of a kid.
Granting that they may chance to draw the movements of an ordinary kid
after a fashion, they certainly would have to acknowledge themselves at
a loss how to draw the motions of these kids. When one month, or even
twenty days old, they would leap up upon high places and throw
themselves on to the ground in a way that if any other but a kid were
to do so, not one limb would be left whole. As it pleased me, I ordered
them always to be kept near me, and I gave each of them an appropriate
name. I am much delighted with them, and pay great attention to
bringing together m&#257;rk&#863;h&#363;r males and well-bred
she-goats. I desire to have many young ones from them, and that they
may become well known among men. After their young shall have paired,
most probably more delicate ones will be obtained. One of their
peculiarities is that ordinary kids immediately they are born, and
until they begin to suck, make a great bleating, whilst these, on the
contrary, make no sound, and stand quite contented and without wailing.
Perhaps their flesh would be very pleasant to the taste.</p>
<p class="par">Before this, an order had been given that Muqarrab K.,
having been appointed to Bihar, should hasten off there. He came to
Court in order to pay his respects before he repaired to his
destination, and accordingly, on Thursday, the 2nd
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, an elephant with trappings, two horses, and a
jewelled <i>khapwa</i> were conferred on him, and he took leave. Rs.
50,000 were given him as an advance of pay. On the same day Sard&#257;r
K&#863;h&#257;n received a dress of honour, an elephant, and a horse,
and obtained the Sarkar of Monghyr, which is in <span class=

S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, sent with him the brother of Afz&#803;al

please, and repeatedly importuned me for a portrait, I presented him,
at his request, with my likeness, a jewelled <i>khapwa</i>, and a
<i>ph&#363;l ka&#7789;&#257;ra</i>. 24,000 <i>darb</i>, a jewelled

M&#299;r S&#863;har&#299;f. F&#257;z&#803;il K., director of buildings,

H&#803;ak&#299;m R&#257;gho N&#257;th to that of 600 personal and 60
horse. As at this time the anniversary of the late king (Akbar)
occurred, Rs. 5,000 were handed over to some of my chief servants to
divide among poor and deserving people. H&#803;asan &#703;Al&#299; K.,
jagirdar of the Sarkar of Monghyr, was honoured with the mansab of
2,500 personal and horse, and sent to the assistance of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang, governor of the province of
Bengal, and he was presented with a sword. As M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;harafu-d-d&#299;n H&#803;usain K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;

Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500

to me by way of offering. Undoubtedly, of their own kind they are the
finest. One of these I gave to my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n. On
Thursday, the 9th, S&#257;d&#257;t K. was granted the mansab of 1,000
personal and 60 horse. On this day &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula and

and a <i>fota</i>, so that he might wear them and be distinguished on
the day of meeting me and of having the good fortune to pay his
respects. According to his request, I sent by the hand of his Vakil,
S&#863;har&#299;f, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>a sumptuous dress of honour with a
<i>ch&#299;ra</i> and a special sash. On Thursday, the 23rd,
M&#299;rz&#257; W&#257;l&#299;, son of the aunt of this suppliant, came
by order from the Deccan, and had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold. His father, K&#863;hw&#257;ja H&#803;asan
K&#863;h&#257;ld&#257;r (the freckled?), was one of the
Naqs&#863;hband&#299; K&#863;hw&#257;jas. My uncle, M&#299;rz&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, gave his sister in marriage to the
K&#863;hw&#257;ja. I heard much praise of the K&#863;hw&#257;ja from
people: he had both good family and got on well with every one, and for
a long time the management of the affairs of my uncle M&#299;rz&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m had been in his hands, and he was on
very good terms with him. Before the M&#299;rz&#257;&rsquo;s death he
had himself delivered<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2832src" href=
"#xd24e2832" name="xd24e2832src">22</a> over the deposit of his life.
Two sons survived him&mdash;viz., M&#299;rz&#257;
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n and M&#299;rz&#257; W&#257;l&#299;. M.
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, after the death of the M&#299;rz&#257;,
ran away, and went to M&#257;-war&#257;&#702;a-n-nahr (Transoxania),
and in that exile became a traveller on the road of non-existence. The
Begam and M&#299;rz&#257; W&#257;l&#299; came to the glorious Court,
and H.M. (Akbar) behaved very kindly to the Begam. The M&#299;rz&#257;
also is a steady and sedate young man, not devoid of reasonableness and
understanding. He is very skilled in the science of music. At this time
it occurred to me to marry the daughter of the deceased Prince
D&#257;niy&#257;l to the M&#299;rz&#257;, and my reason for sending for
the M&#299;rz&#257; to Court was this. This girl (Bul&#257;q&#299;
Begam) is the offspring of the daughter of Qil&#299;j Muh&#803;ammad K.
It is hoped that the grace of striving to please and to serve, which is
the means of good fortune and prosperity, may be his (M.
W&#257;l&#299;&rsquo;s) lot and fortune.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Sarbuland R&#257;y, who had been sent on
duty to the Deccan, was promoted to the mansab of 2,500 personal and
1,500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that a
<i>Shayy&#257;d</i> (a loud talker, a cheat) of the name of
S&#863;haik&#863;h<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2842src" href=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>net of hypocrisy and deceit in Sirhind, and caught
in it many of the apparent worshippers without spirituality, and had
sent into every city and country one of his disciples, whom he called
his deputy (k&#863;hal&#299;fa), and whom he considered more skilled
than others in the adorning of shops (of deceit) and selling of
religious knowledge, and in deceiving men. He had also written a number
of idle tales to his disciples and his believers, and had made them
into a book which he called <i>Makt&#363;b&#257;t</i> (letters). In
that album (<i>Jung</i>) of absurdities many unprofitable things had
been written that drag (people) into infidelity and impiety. Amongst
these he had written in a letter as follows: &ldquo;In the course of my
travels I had come to the dwelling of the Two Lights (the Sun and
Moon), and saw a very lofty and very splendid building. From there I
passed to the abode of Discrimination (F&#257;r&#363;q), and from there
I passed to the abode of Truth (&#7778;idd&#299;q), and to each I wrote
a suitable explanation (or perhaps, of each I wrote a suitable
description). From there I reached the abode of Love, and I beheld a
brilliant dwelling. It had divers colours and lights and reflected
glories. That is to say (God forgive us!&mdash;an exclamation of
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s), I passed from the abode of the Vicegerents
(k&#863;hulaf&#257;) and attained to the highest rank.&rdquo; There
were other presumptuous expressions which it would be too long to
write, and would be contrary to good manners. I <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e2859" title="Source: according">accordingly</span> gave an order
that they should bring him to the Court that is based on justice.
According to order he came to pay his respects. To all that I asked him
he could give no reasonable answer, and appeared to me to be extremely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>proud and self-satisfied, with all his ignorance.
I considered the best thing for him would be that he should remain some
time in the prison of correction until the heat of his temperament and
confusion of his brain were somewhat quenched, and the excitement of
the people also should subside. He was accordingly handed over to
An&#299;r&#257;&#702;&#299; Singh-dalan to be imprisoned in Gwalior
fort.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 25th K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d, my
fortunate son Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z came from Allahabad, and
with prostration at the threshold of the Khalifate illuminated the
forehead of sincerity. After he had performed the ceremony of kissing
the ground and been honoured with special favour, I bade him sit. He
presented 2,000 muhars and 2,000 rupees by way of <i>naz&#817;r</i>,
and made an offering of a diamond. As his elephants had not yet
arrived, he would produce them on another occasion. He had brought with
him to the Court, which is the asylum of the world, R&#257;ja
Kaly&#257;n, Zamindar of Ratanp&#363;r, against whom this my son had by
order sent an army, and had taken from him as an offering 80 elephants
and Rs. 100,000. My son brought him with him, and he had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold. Waz&#299;r K., my son&rsquo;s Diwan who
is one of the old servants of the Court, having had the good fortune to
pay his respects to me, presented as offerings 28 elephants, male and
female. Of these nine were accepted, and the rest bestowed on him.</p>
<p class="par">As it had been represented to me that Muruwwat K., s.
Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K., who was one born and bred up at this Court, had
fought with a band of Maghs on the borders of Bengal and had sacrificed
his life, I promoted All&#257;h-y&#257;r, his brother, to the mansab of
1,000 personal and 500 horse, and another brother to that of 400
personal and horse, so that those he had left behind should not be
distressed. On Monday, the 3rd of the Divine month of T&#299;r, in the
neighbourhood of the city four black bucks, a doe, and a fawn were
taken. As I passed by the house of my fortunate son, Sult&#804;&#257;n
Parw&#299;z, he presented two tusked elephants with their trappings by
way of offering; both were ordered to be placed in the private
elephant-stud.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 13th, Sayyid H&#803;asan, the
ambassador of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=

&#703;Abb&#257;s, ruler of Persia, having had the good fortune to kiss
the threshold, produced a letter, together with a crystal drinking-cup,
on the cover of which was a ruby. As it was given from excessive
friendship and sincerity it was the cause of the increase of amity and
good fellowship. On this day Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. was promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, and Na&#7779;ru-llah, s.
Fath&#803;u-llah, in whose charge was the fort of Ambar, that of 1,500
personal and 400 horse. On Thursday, the 20th, Am&#257;nu-llah, s.
Mah&#257;bat K., was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 800
horse. Having conferred on Waz&#299;r K. the Diwanship of Bengal, I
gave him a horse, a dress of honour, and a jewelled dagger. Elephants
were given to M&#299;r H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n and Zabar-dast K.
On this day H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; H&#803;asan, a servant of
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, came to Court with a precious letter
from my brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, and a report from
that pillar of the Sultanate (K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam). He laid
before me a dagger the hilt of which was made of a
fish&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2875src" href="#xd24e2875"
name="xd24e2875src">24</a> tooth spotted with black, that my brother
had given to K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam. As it was a great rarity,
he (K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam) had sent it to me. I greatly
approved of it; in fact, it is a rare present. I had never seen a
spotted one until now, and I was much pleased.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 27th, M. W&#257;l&#299; was promoted to
the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000 horse. On the 24th, I gave 1,000
darbs as a present to Sayyid H&#803;asan, the ambassador, and an
elephant to &#703;Abdu-llah K. Bah&#257;dur F&#299;r&#363;z-jang. On
Thursday, the 2nd of the Divine month of Amurd&#257;d, a horse was
presented to I&#703;tib&#257;r K. &#703;&#256;qil K. was promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 800 horse.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Saturday, the 4th of the Il&#257;h&#299;
month of Amurd&#257;d, corresponding with 15 S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n,
was the feast of the S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t. By order, they decorated
and brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>before me on the river, boats with lamps and all
kinds of fireworks. In truth, the lamps they had arranged appeared very
pretty, and for a long time I enjoyed myself in going round and looking
at them. On Tuesday, M&#299;r&#257;n,<a class="noteref" id=

horse, and K&#863;hw&#257;ja Muh&#803;sin for that of 700 personal and
100 horse. On Thursday, the 9th, I went to hunt at the village of
Sam&#363;nagar. Passing my time pleasantly in going round and hunting
on that pleasant plain until Monday, I returned on the eve of Tuesday
to the palace. On Thursday, the 16th, Bis&#863;h&#363;tan, grandson of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l (the author), was promoted to
the mansab of 700 personal and 350 horse. On this day I went round to
see the garden of Gul-afs&#863;h&#257;n, which is on the bank of the
Jumna. On the way rain fell heavily and filled the mead with freshness
and greenness. Pineapples had arrived at perfection, and I made a
thorough inspection. Of the buildings that overlooked the river
none<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2900src" href="#xd24e2900" name=
"xd24e2900src">26</a> that I saw were without the charm of verdure and
flowing water. These verses of Anwar&#299; appeared appropriate to the
place:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4><span class="sc">Verse.</span></h4>

</div>
<p class="par first">As this garden is in the charge of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, he presented me as offerings with some
pieces of brocade of a new fashion they had lately brought for him from
&#703;Ir&#257;q. Selecting what I approved of, I presented the
remainder to him. He had arranged the garden well, and his mansab was
ordered to be raised to 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse, original and
increased. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=

<p class="par">A strange circumstance was that I was so much delighted
with a jewelled dagger-hilt of piebald teeth which K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam had got from S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s and sent
to me (see <i>ante</i>), that I appointed several skilful men to go to
&#298;r&#257;n and T&#363;r&#257;n to look for them and to be
consistently searching for them, and to bring some from anywhere and
any person, anyhow, and at any price. Many of my servants who knew my
disposition, and dignified Am&#299;rs in the course of their duty,
engaged in the search. It happened that in this city a stupid stranger
bought in the open bazaar a coloured tooth of great beauty and delicacy
for a trifle; he believed that some time or other it had fallen into
the fire, and that the black on it was the mark of burning! After some
time he showed it to one of the carpenters on the establishment of my
prosperous son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, desiring that he should take
off a piece of the tooth in order to make a ring (<i>s&#863;hast</i>),
and pointed out that he should remove the marks of burning and the
blacknesses, being ignorant that the blackness enhanced the value and
price of the whiteness. Those moles and patches were what the tirewoman
of destiny had given as an adornment of its beauty. The carpenter at
once went to the Superintendent of his workshop, and gave him the good
news that such a rare and precious thing, in search of which people
were wandering and going long distances, and hastening to all corners
and in all directions in various countries, had fallen for nothing into
the hands of an ignorant man, who did not know its value. It could be
easily and cheaply obtained from him. The Superintendent went off with
him and immediately procured it, and next day produced it before my
son. When my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n came to wait on me, he at
first showed great delight, and after his brain had become free from
the intoxication of the wine of joy, produced it, and greatly pleased
me&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">On this day Bahl&#299;m K., one of the chief servants of

out of sincerity, I bestowed on him unstinted favours, and presented
him with a dress of honour, a horse, a sword, and 10,000 darbs, with
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. At this time a petition
came from K&#863;h&#257;n Daur&#257;n, stating that: &ldquo;Your
Majesty, from the perfection of kindness and knowledge of his worth,
had appointed to the government of Thatta (Sind) an old slave,
notwithstanding his great age and weak sight. As this weak old man was
exceedingly bent and decrepit, and had not in him the ability to exert
himself or to ride, he prays that he may be excused military service,
and that he may be enrolled in the army of prayer.&rdquo; At his
request, I ordered the chief Diwans to confirm him in the pargana of
Khush&#257;b,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2942src" href="#xd24e2942"

jagir, and which had become peopled and cultivated, by way of providing
for his expenses, so that he might pass his time in easy circumstances.
His eldest son, by name S&#863;h&#257;h Muh&#803;ammad, was promoted to

difficult hilltops might be accomplished with ease, and that the men

the 13th, having gone to the garden of N&#363;r-manzil, I passed the
time in enjoyment in that rose-garden of delight until Sunday, the

M&#257;ndp&#363;r, which is his native place, and had the good fortune
to kiss the threshold, and by way of offering presented an elephant and
a jewelled plume. Maq&#7779;&#363;d K. was honoured with the mansab of
1,000 personal and 130 horse. On Thursday, the 20th, my son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z produced two elephants as an offering, and
they were ordered to be included in the private stud. On the 24th of
the aforesaid month the feast of the solar weighing took place in the
palace of Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n&#299;, and my 51st year according to the

sheath and fastenings were given to skilful men, each of whom was
unique in his age in his art. Truly, it was all carried out according
to my wish. One hilt came out coloured in such a way as to create
astonishment. It turned out of all the seven colours, and some of the
flowers looked as if a skilful painter<a class="noteref" id=

short, it was so delicate that I never wish it to be apart from me for
a moment. Of all the gems of great price that are in the treasury I
consider it the most precious. On Thursday I girded it auspiciously and
with joy round my waist, and the masters who in their completion had
exercised great skill and taken great pains were rewarded, Ust&#257;d

him to the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, with a standard
and the title of Raja, and his younger brother to that of 500 personal
and 250 horse, and gave him a jagir in his native country.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 10th of Mihr, at the request of
&#256;&#7779;af K., I went to his house built on the bank of the Jumna.
He has erected a very fine bath-house (h&#803;amm&#257;m), with which I
was much delighted. After bathing, a feast of cups was held, and my
private servants were made happy with cups of delight. Having chosen
out of his offerings what I approved, I gave the remainder to him. What
I took of his offering might be of the value of Rs. 30,000. B&#257;qir
K., faujd&#257;r of Multan, was honoured with a standard.</p>
<p class="par">Previously to this, according to order, they had planted
trees on both sides from Agra as far as the River of Attock (the
Indus), and had made an avenue, and in the same way from Agra to
Bengal. I now ordered that from Agra to Lahore they should put up a
pillar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3028src" href="#xd24e3028" name=
"xd24e3028src">37</a> (<i>m&#299;l</i>) at every koss, to be the sign
of a koss, and at every three koss make a well, so that wayfarers might
travel in ease and contentment, and not endure hardships from thirst or
the heat of the sun.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 24th of Mihr, the festival of the
Dasahr&#257; was held. After the custom of India, they decorated the
horses and produced them before me. After I had seen the horses they
brought some of the elephants. As Mu&#703;tamid K. on last New
Year&rsquo;s Day had not made any offering, at this festival he
presented a golden tablet (<i>tak&#863;ht</i>), a ruby ring, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>piece of coral (<i>bussad</i>), and other items.
The tablet was beautifully made. The total value of the offering was
Rs. 16,000. As he had brought the things from pure sincerity and
loyalty, they were accepted. On this day Zabar-dast K. was promoted to
the mansab of 1,000 personal and 400 horse. As the day of the
Dasahr&#257; had been fixed as the time of starting, I embarked on a
boat with all happy omens and pleasure in the evening, and went on to
my goal. I halted for eight days at the first stage that the men might
come on, after making all preparations at leisure. Mah&#257;bat K. had
sent apples from Bangash by runners (<i>d&#257;k-chok&#299;</i>). They
arrived very fresh, and were of excellent flavour. I was greatly
pleased in eating them. They cannot be compared with the
<i>s&#299;b-i-k&#863;h&#363;b</i> (&ldquo;the good<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3052src" href="#xd24e3052" name="xd24e3052src">38</a>
apples&rdquo;?) of Kabul which I ate there, or with the Samarkand
apples that they bring every year. For sweetness and delicacy of
flavour they cannot be compared with either of the latter (<i>i.e.</i>,
the Bangash apples were far better). I had until now never seen such
delicate and delicious apples. They say that in Upper Bangash, near
Lashkar-dara,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3061src" href="#xd24e3061"
name="xd24e3061src">39</a> there is a village called S&#299;v R&#257;m,
in which there are three trees of this apple, and although they have
made many trials, they have never found so good ones in any other
place. I gave Sayyid H&#803;asan, ambassador of my brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, a dish of these apples in order that
he might tell me if there were any better apples in &#703;Ir&#257;q. He
said: &ldquo;In the whole of Persia the apples of Isfahan are
preferred, and they are of the same quality as these.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 1st of the Divine month of
&#256;b&#257;n, I went on pilgrimage to the mausoleum of the late king
(Akbar) (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!), and rubbed the
head of supplication on the threshold, the abode of angels, and
presented 100 muhars as nazar. All the Begams and other ladies, having
sought the blessing of circulating round that shrine, which is the
circling-place of angels, presented offerings. On the eve of Friday a
lofty assembly was held <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>of the holy men
(<i>Mas&#863;h&#257;&#702;ik&#863;h</i>), the turbaned people
(<i>arb&#257;b-i-&#703;am&#257;&#702;im</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
ecclesiastics, etc.), <i>H&#803;uff&#257;z&#804;</i> (those who recite
the Qoran), and singing people, assembled in numbers, and practised
ecstasies and religious dancing (<i>wajd</i> and
<i>sam&#257;&#703;</i>), to each of whom, according to the
circumstances of his merit and skill, I gave a dress of honour, a
<i>farj&#299;</i>, and a shawl. The buildings of this blessed mausoleum
have been made very lofty. At this time the money expended satisfied
me, and was far more than it had previously been. (The MS.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3090src" href="#xd24e3090" name=
"xd24e3090src">40</a> here is clear, and the printed words wrong.)</p>
<p class="par">On the 3rd, after four gharis of day had passed, I
marched on from that stage, and having traversed 5&frac12; koss by the
river at four gharis of the day, arrived at the next stage. After
midday I left the boat and caught seven partridges
(<i>durr&#257;j</i>). At the end of the day I gave Rs. 20,000 to Sayyid
H&#803;asan, the ambassador (of Persia), as a present, and a dress of
honour of gold brocade with a jewelled <i>j&#299;g&#863;ha</i>
(turban-ornament), and an elephant, and gave him leave to return, and
sent for my brother with him a jewelled jug made in the shape of a
cock, which could hold my usual stint of wine. It is hoped that it may
reach its destination in safety. I gave leave to Las&#863;hkar K., who
had been appointed to the defence and government of Agra, with a gift
of a dress of honour, a horse, an elephant, drums, and a jewelled
dagger. Ikr&#257;m K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and
1,500 horse, and to the duty of faujd&#257;r of the Sark&#257;r of
Mew&#257;t. He is s. Isl&#257;m K., who was the grandson of the
venerable asylum of pardon S&#863;haik&#863;h Sal&#299;m, whose
excellency of person and approved disposition and connection in
blessing with this illustrious family have been described in these
pages with the pen of sincerity.</p>
<p class="par">At this time I heard from a certain person whose words
are adorned with the light of truth that at the time when I was sick
and weak at Ajmir, before this evil news arrived <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>in
the province of Bengal, one day Isl&#257;m K. was sitting in private,
when he suddenly became unconscious. When he came to himself he said to
one of his confidants, of the name of Bh&#299;kan, that it had been
shown him from the world of mysteries that the holy person of the
Emperor had been attacked by sickness, and that the remedy for it was
to sacrifice for him something that was exceedingly dear and precious
to himself. It at first occurred to him to sacrifice for the head of
the revered one his own son H&#363;s&#863;hang, but as he was young in
years and as yet had derived no profit from life, and not attained to
the desire of his heart, he had compassion on him, and would sacrifice
himself for his lord and master. He hoped that as this was from the
bottom of his heart, and the sincerity of his being, it would be
accepted at the throne of Allah. The arrow of prayer at once reached
the target of acceptance, and he perceived himself afflicted with
weakness and disease. Verily, verily, the disease increased till he
reached the neighbourhood of the compassion of God (he died). The Great
Physician bestowed from the hidden dispensary complete recovery on this
suppliant. Although the late king (the lights of Allah be his
testimony!), was much attached to the children and grandchildren of the
S&#863;haik&#863;hu-l-Isl&#257;m, and bestowed favours on them all
according to the capacity and aptitude of each, yet when the turn of
rule came to this suppliant, they received great kindnesses in order to
perform what was due to that revered one (Sal&#299;m
Chis&#863;ht&#299;), and many of them attained to the high nobility,
and were advanced to the posts of head of Subahs, as has been brought
to record each in its own place.</p>
<p class="par">As in this village the eunuch Hil&#257;l K.,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3110src" href="#xd24e3110" name=
"xd24e3110src">41</a> who was one of my attendants from the time when I
was prince, had built a <i>sar&#257;y</i>, and made a garden, he made
an offering to me. In order to dignify him I took a trifle from him.
After marching four stages from this halting-place, the army of
prosperity encamped outside Mathura. On Thursday, the 8th, I went to
see Bindr&#257;ban and the idol temples of that place. <span class=

ornamented them highly on the outside, inside them bats and owls

on account of the malodours one could not breathe.</p>

<p class="par first">On this day Muk&#863;hli&#7779; K., according to
order, came from Bengal, and had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold. He gave 100 muhars and 100 rupees as nazar, and by way of
offering, a ruby and jewelled aigrette (t&#804;urra). On Friday, the
9th, Rs. 600,000 of treasure for the maintenance
(<i>z&#817;ak&#863;h&#299;ra</i>) of the fort of &#256;s&#299;r were
sent to the Commander-in-Chief,
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n.</p>
<p class="par">In the foregoing pages, something has been written about
Gos&#257;&#702;&#299;n Jadr&#363;p,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3151src"
href="#xd24e3151" name="xd24e3151src">44</a> who lived as a hermit in
Ujain. At this time he changed his residence to Mathura, which is one
of the greatest places of worship of the Hindus, and employed himself
in the worship of the true God on the bank of the Jumna. As I valued
his society, I hastened to wait on him, and for a long time enjoyed his
company without the presence of any stranger. In truth, his existence
is a great gain to me: one can be greatly benefited and delighted.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 10th, the huntsmen represented that
there was in that neighbourhood a tiger that greatly troubled
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>and injured the ryots and wayfarers. I
immediately ordered them to bring together a number of elephants and
surround the forest and at the end of the day myself rode out with my
ladies. As I had vowed that I would not injure any living thing with my
own hand, I told N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3161src" href="#xd24e3161" name="xd24e3161src">45</a> to shoot at
him. An elephant is not at ease when it smells a tiger, and is
continually in movement, and to hit with a gun from a litter
(<i>&#703;im&#257;r&#299;</i>) is a very difficult matter, insomuch
that M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, who, after me, is unequalled in shooting,
has several times missed three or four shots from an elephant. Yet
N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n B. so hit the tiger with one shot that it was
immediately killed.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 12th, my desire to see the
Gos&#257;&#702;&#299;n Jadr&#363;p again increased, and hastening to
his hut, without ceremony, I enjoyed his society. Sublime words were
spoken between us. God Almighty has granted him an unusual grace, a
lofty understanding, an exalted nature, and sharp intellectual powers,
with a God-given knowledge and a heart free from the attachments of the
world, so that, putting behind his back the world and all that is in
it, he sits content in the corner of solitude and without wants. He has
chosen of worldly goods half a <i>gaz</i> of old cotton
(<i>kirp&#257;s</i>) like a woman&rsquo;s veil, and a piece of
earthenware from which to drink water, and in winter and summer and the
rainy season lives naked and with his head and feet bare. He has made a
hole in which he can turn round with a hundred difficulties and
tortures, with a passage such that a suckling could hardly be put
through it. These two or three couplets of H&#803;ak&#299;m
San&#257;&#702;&#299; (may God have mercy on him!) appeared
appropriate:</p>

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 14th, I again went to visit the
Gos&#257;&#702;&#299;n and bade him good-bye. Undoubtedly parting from
him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>weighed upon my mind, that desires the truth. On
Thursday the 15th, I marched and pitched near Brind&#257;ban. At this
stage my fortunate son Sult&#804;&#257;n Parw&#299;z took leave of me
for Allahabad, and went to his jagir. I had intended that he should
accompany me on this expedition, but as he had already shown symptoms
of distress, I could not avoid letting him go. I presented him with a
tipch&#257;q horse, a waist dagger with a veined
(<i>jauhar-d&#257;r</i>) walrus-tooth (hilt), and a sword and special
shield. I hope he will come again soon, and have the good fortune of my
presence. As the period of K&#863;husrau&rsquo;s imprisonment had been
a long one, it seemed to me that to keep him longer in confinement and
deprive him of the good fortune of waiting on me, would be wanting in
kindness. I accordingly sent<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3314src" href=
"#xd24e3314" name="xd24e3314src">47</a> for him and bade him salute me.
Once again the marks of his offences were washed with the pure water of
forgiveness, and the dust of disgrace and humiliation was rubbed off
his brow. I hope that the blessing of pleasing me, and the grace of
service may be his lot.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 16th, I gave leave to Muk&#863;hli&#7779;
K., whom I had sent for to take up the duties of diwan to
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, and I gave him the rank he had<a class=

"xd24e3319src">48</a> had in Bengal&mdash;viz., 2,000 with 700 horse.
On Saturday I halted. At this stage Sayyid Niz&#803;&#257;m s. M&#299;r
M&#299;r&#257;n &#7778;adr Jah&#257;n, who was faujd&#257;r of Kanauj,
waited upon me, and presented two elephants, and some hawks. I accepted
one elephant and a pair of hawks. On Sunday, the 18th, we marched. At
this time the King of Persia had sent with Par&#299; Beg M&#299;r
S&#863;hik&#257;r (chief <span class="corr" id="xd24e3328" title=
"Source: hunstman">huntsman</span>) one falcon (s&#863;hunq&#257;r) of
good colour. There was another which had been given to the
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam. This one was sent along with the
S&#863;h&#257;h&#299; falcon (<i>i.e.</i>, the one intended for
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r), and it died on the road. The S&#863;h&#257;h&#299;
falcon, too, got mauled by a cat owing to the carelessness of the
M&#299;r S&#863;hik&#257;r. Though it was brought to Court, it did not
live more than a week. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=

id="xd24e3336src" href="#xd24e3336" name="xd24e3336src">49</a> of the
beauty and colour of this falcon? There were many beautiful black
markings on each wing, and back, and sides. As it was something out of
the common, I ordered Ust&#257;d Man&#7779;&#363;r, who has the title
of <i>N&#257;diru-l-&#703;a&#7779;r</i> (wonder of the age) to paint
and preserve<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3343src" href="#xd24e3343"

S&#863;hik&#257;r Rs. 2,000 and dismissed him.</p>
<p class="par">In my father&rsquo;s reign (the light of God be his

time it came into my mind: &ldquo;Why should I act contrary to his
rules?&rdquo; It would be better to have it still of 30 dams. One day
Gos&#257;&#702;&#299;n Jadr&#363;p said that in the book of the Vedas,
which the lords of his faith had written, the weight of the
<i>s&#299;r</i> was 36 dams. &ldquo;As from the coincidences of the
hidden world your order has fallen in with what is laid down in our
book, if it be fixed at 36 dams, it will be well.&rdquo; It was ordered
that hereafter throughout the whole territory it should be 36 dams.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 19th, I marched. A horse and dress of
honour were given to R&#257;ja Bh&#257;o Singh, who had been ordered to
the support of the army of the Deccan. From this day, till Wednesday,
the 28th, I made successive marches. On Thursday, the 29th, Delhi, the
abode of blessings, was adorned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109"
href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>by the alighting of the army
of good fortune. At first I hastened with my children and the ladies on
a visit to the enlightened shrine of Hum&#257;y&#363;n (may the lights
of God be his testimony!), and having made our offerings there, went
off to circumambulate the blessed mausoleum of the king of holy men
(S&#863;haik&#863;h Niz&#804;&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n Chis&#863;ht&#299;),
and strengthened my courage, and at the end of the day alighted at the
palace, which had been got ready in Sal&#299;mga&#7771;h. On Friday,
the 30th, I halted. As they had at this time preserved the
hunting-place of the pargana of P&#257;lam, according to order, it was
represented that a great number of antelope had collected there.
Accordingly, on the 1st of the Divine month of &#256;z&#817;ar I
started to hunt<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3388src" href="#xd24e3388"
name="xd24e3388src">52</a> with cheetahs. At the end of the day, during
the hunt, much hail fell of the size of apples, and made the air very
cold. On this day three antelope were caught. On Sunday, the 2nd, I
hunted 46 antelope, and on Monday, the 3rd, 24 antelope were caught
with cheetahs. My son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n killed two antelope
with his gun. On Tuesday, the 4th, five antelope were caught. On
Wednesday, the 5th, 27 antelope were caught. On Thursday, the 6th,
Sayyid Bahwa Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;, who was in charge of the
government of Delhi, made an offering of three elephants and eighteen
horses, and other things. One elephant and other things were accepted,
and I gave the rest to him. H&#257;s&#863;him of K&#863;host,
faujd&#257;r of some parganas in Mew&#257;t, had the honour of kissing
the threshold. I employed myself within the limits of P&#257;lam until
Thursday, the 13th, in hunting with cheetahs. In the space of twelve
days 426 antelopes were caught, and I returned to Delhi. I had heard,
when in attendance on my father, that it is impossible for an antelope
that has escaped from the grasp of a cheetah to live, although it has
not been injured by its claws. In this hunt I, in order to ascertain
the fact, released several antelopes of handsome appearance and strong
bodies, before they had received any wounds from teeth or claws, and
ordered them to be kept in my presence, and that they should be taken
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=

remained at ease in their natural conditions: on the second day a
change was observed, and they threw about their legs as if they were
drunk, without any reason, and fell down and rose up. However much
<i>tiry&#257;q-i-f&#257;r&#363;q&#299;</i> (preparation of opium) and
other suitable medicines were administered to them, they had no effect,
and when one watch had passed in this condition, they died.</p>
<p class="par">On this day the bad news arrived that the eldest son of
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z had died at Agra. As he was somewhat
grown-up,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3398src" href="#xd24e3398" name=
"xd24e3398src">53</a> and was very attached and affectionate towards
his father, the latter was exceedingly grieved and wounded at heart at
this event, and great bewilderment and weakness manifested themselves
in him. In order to console and please him, I sent him gracious
letters, and covered over the deadly wound of his heart with the balm
of affection and kindness. I hope that God, the great and glorious, may
grant him patience and resignation, for in this kind of calamities
there can be no better driver away of grief than endurance and
resignation.</p>

On account of her previous service and her hereditary attachment to
this illustrious family, when the late king made me a married man, he
took her from my sister S&#863;h&#257;h-z&#257;da K&#863;h&#257;nam,
and placed her in charge of my Zanana. It is 33 years from that date
that she has been in my service, and I esteem her greatly, for she has
served me with sincerity. In no journey or expedition had she of her
own will remained absent from attendance on me. When she felt her
increasing age, she requested me to order her to remain at Delhi, and
to spend the remainder of her life in prayer for me, for she had no
longer the power to move about, and found it a great hardship and
trouble to come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>and go (as she used). One of her felicities
was that she was of the same age<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3414src"
href="#xd24e3414" name="xd24e3414src">55</a> as
&#703;Ars&#863;h-&#257;s&#863;hy&#257;n&#299; (Akbar). In brief, with a
view to giving her rest, I ordered her to remain at Delhi, and in that
place she had made for herself a garden, a saray, and a tomb, in the
constructing which she has employed herself for some time past. In
short, to please this ancient servitor, I went to her house, and
strictly ordered Sayyid Bahwa, the governor of the city, to serve and
guard her in such a manner that no dust from any road of vexation might
settle on the hem of her contentment.</p>
<p class="par">On this day R&#257;ja Kis&#863;han D&#257;s was promoted
to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 300 horse, original and increased.
As Sayyid Bahwa<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3419src" href="#xd24e3419"
name="xd24e3419src">56</a> had performed satisfactorily the duties of
faujd&#257;r of Delhi, and the people of the place were much pleased
with his excellent conduct, according to previous custom, the
protection and administration of the city of Delhi and the
faujd&#257;rship of the surrounding country were entrusted to him, and
he was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600 horse, original
and increased, and he was presented with an elephant, and allowed to
take leave. On Saturday, the 15th, I honoured M&#299;rz&#257;
W&#257;l&#299; with the mansab of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, and presenting
him with a standard and an elephant, appointed him to the Deccan.
S&#863;haik&#863;h &#703;Abdu-l-H&#803;aqq Dihlaw&#299;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3422src" href="#xd24e3422" name=
"xd24e3422src">57</a> who was a pious and estimable man, had the good
fortune to pay his respects to me. He had composed a book containing
the biographies of the S&#863;haik&#863;hs of India, and produced it to
me. He had endured some hardships, and for a long time had lived in
Delhi in seclusion, and the practice of reliance on God, and of
asceticism. He is a very worthy man, and his company is not without
pleasure (for me). Bestowing various kinds of kindnesses on him, I
dismissed him.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 16th, I marched from Delhi, and on
Friday, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>the 21st, halted in the pargana of
Kair&#257;na.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3429src" href="#xd24e3429"
name="xd24e3429src">58</a> This pargana is the native place of Muqarrab
K. Its climate is equable and its soil good. Muqarrab had made
buildings and gardens there. As I had often heard praise of his garden,
I wished much to see it. On Saturday, the 22nd, I and my ladies were
much pleased in going round it. Truly, it is a very fine and enjoyable
garden. Within a masonry (<i>puk&#863;hta</i>, pucca) wall, flower-beds
have been laid out to the extent of 140 bighas. In the middle of the
garden he has constructed a pond, in length 220 yards, and in breadth
200 yards. In the middle of the pond is a <i>m&#257;h-t&#257;b</i>
terrace (for use in moonlight) 22 yards square. There is no kind of
tree belonging to a warm or cold climate that is not to be found in it.
Of fruit-bearing trees belonging to Persia I saw green pistachio-trees,
and cypresses of graceful form, such as I have never seen before. I
ordered the cypresses to be counted, and they came to 300. All round
the pond suitable buildings have been begun and are in progress.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 24th, K&#863;hanjar K., in whose charge
is the Fort of Ahmadnagar, was promoted to the mansab of 2,500 personal
and 1,600 horse. On Wednesday, the 26th, the Giver of Bounties gave my
son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n a son by the daughter of &#256;&#7779;af
K&#863;h&#257;n. He presented an offering of 1,000 muhars, and begged
for a name for him. I gave him the name of Um&#299;d-bak&#863;hs&#863;h
(bestower of hope). I hope his advent<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3440src" href="#xd24e3440" name="xd24e3440src">59</a> may be
auspicious to this State. On Thursday, the 27th, I halted. In these few
days I was delighted with hawking the <i>jarz</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3445src" href="#xd24e3445" name="xd24e3445src">60</a> (bustard or
florican) and <i>t&#363;g&#863;h-d&#257;r&#299;</i> (also a kind of
bustard). I ordered the <i>jarz-i-b&#363;r</i> (the red bustard?) to be
weighed. It came to 2&frac14; <i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;</i> sirs, and
the variegated (<i>ablaq</i>) one to 2&#8539; sirs. The large
t&#363;g&#863;h-d&#257;r&#299; was &frac14; sir heavier than the
jarz-i-b&#363;r. On Thursday, the 5th of the Divine month of Day, I
left the boat at Akbarpur, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113"
href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>the victorious army then
marched by land. From Agra to this halting-place, which is situated
within two koss of the pargana of Buriya,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3463src" href="#xd24e3463" name="xd24e3463src">61</a> is by river
123 koss or 91 koss by road. I did it in 34 marches and 17 halts. In
addition to this I delayed a week in leaving the city, and 12 days in
sporting in P&#257;lam: altogether (I took) 70 days. On this day
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K. came from Bih&#257;r, and had the good
fortune to pay his respects. He presented 100 muhars and Rs. 100. From
the last Thursday to Wednesday, the 11th, I marched every day. On
Thursday, the 12th, I was pleased with going round to see the garden of
Sirhind. It is one of the old gardens, and has old trees in it. It has
not the freshness it formerly had, but it is still valuable.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Wais&#299;, who is well acquainted with agriculture
and buildings, was appointed the <i>karor&#299;</i> of Sirhind for the
purpose of keeping the garden in order. I had sent him off from Agra
before I marched from the capital, and he had put it somewhat in order.
I strictly enjoined him again that he should remove all the old trees
that had no freshness in them, and put in fresh plants, to clean up the
<i>&#703;irqband&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3471src" href=
"#xd24e3471" name="xd24e3471src">62</a> (it is
<i>&#703;ir&#257;q-band&#299;</i> in the text. The word does not occur
in the B.M. MS. but is in the I.O. MS.), and repair the old buildings,
and erect other buildings in the shape of baths, etc., in fitting
places. On this date D&#363;st Beg, who was one of the auxiliaries of
&#703;Abdu-llah K., was promoted to the mansab of 700 personal and 50
horse, Muz&#804;affar H&#803;usain, s. Waz&#299;r K., to that of 600
personal and 300 horse. S&#863;haik&#863;h Q&#257;sim was sent to duty
in the Deccan. On Thursday, the 19th, at the request of my auspicious
son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n, I went to his house. On account of the
birth of the son that God Almighty had bestowed on him a grand
entertainment was given, and he presented offerings. Among these was a
short, broad sword<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3481src" href=
"#xd24e3481" name="xd24e3481src">63</a>
(<i>s&#863;hams&#863;h&#299;r-i-n&#299;mcha</i>), which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>was
of Venetian workmanship. The hilt and fastenings were made of a
sapphire<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3494src" href="#xd24e3494" name=
"xd24e3494src">64</a> cut in Europe: in short, it had been beautifully
made. Another offering was an elephant which the Raja of Bagl&#257;na
had presented to my son in Burh&#257;npur. As that elephant was
handsome and well-behaved, it was ordered to be included among the
private elephants. The value of the offerings that were accepted was
Rs. 130,000, and he offered about Rs. 4,000 to his mothers and
benefactors. On this day Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d
Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;, faujd&#257;r of Bhakkar, sent as an offering a
<i>rang</i> (ibex), which he had brought from the hills when it was
small and brought up in his house. It pleased me greatly. Of
<i>m&#257;r-k&#863;h&#363;r</i> and hill sheep I have seen many brought
up in the house, but I never saw a <i>rang</i> (tame). I ordered them
to keep it with the Barbary goats, in order that they might pair and
produce young ones. Without doubt, it is not allied to the
m&#257;r-k&#863;h&#363;r or the quchq&#257;r. Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d
was raised to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 700 horse. On Monday,
the 23rd, having honoured Muq&#299;m K. with a robe of honour, a horse,
an elephant, and jewelled <i>khapwa</i>, I appointed him to Bih&#257;r.
On Sunday, the 29th, a feast was prepared for my auspicious son
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n on the bank of the Biya (Beas), and on the
same day R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t, who was employed in the siege
of K&#257;ng&#7771;a, came to Court, by order, to represent certain
requirements, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On
Monday, the 30th, my son S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n took ten
days&rsquo; leave, and hastened to Lahore in order to see the palace
buildings lately erected. R&#257;ja Bikram&#257;j&#299;t was presented
with a special dagger, a robe of honour, and a horse, and returned to
duty on the siege of K&#257;ng&#7771;a. On Wednesday, the 2nd of the
Divine month of Bahman, the garden of Kal&#257;naur was honoured by my
halting there. At this place my father had ascended the throne.</p>
<p class="par">When the news of the speedy arrival of K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam reached <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>the Court, every day I sent one of
my servants to meet him. I loaded him with all kinds of favours and
kindnesses, and added to his rank and dignity, and I decked the
headings of the farmans sent to him with an impromptu hemistich or
couplet suitable to the occasion, and so filled him with favours. Once
I sent him some <i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;</i> (otto of roses), and
this opening verse came on my tongue:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4><span class="sc">Verse.</span><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3527src"
href="#xd24e3527" name="xd24e3527src">65</a></h4>
<p class="line">&ldquo;To thee I&rsquo;ve sent the scent of myself.</p>
<p class="line">That I may bring thee the more quickly to
myself.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">On Thursday, the 3rd (Bahman), at the garden of
Kal&#257;naur, K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam was honoured by kissing
the threshold. By way of nazar he brought 100 muhars and Rs. 1,000, and
(stated that he) would present his offerings in due course. Zamb&#299;l
Beg, the ambassador of my brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, was
following him with the royal letter and the rarities of that country
(Persia), which he had sent as presents. Of the favours and kindness
conferred by my brother on K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, if I were
to write of them in detail, I should be accused of exaggeration. In
conversation he always gave him the title of K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, and never had him out of his presence. If he ever
voluntarily stayed in his own quarter, he (&#703;Abb&#257;s) would go
there without ceremony, and show him more and more favour. One day
there was a <i>qamurg&#863;ha</i> hunt at Farrukh&#257;b&#257;d, and he
ordered K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam to shoot with a bow. Out of
good manners he brought a bow with two arrows (only). The Shah gave him
50 other arrows from his own quiver. It happened that 50 of these
arrows struck the game, and two arrows missed. Then he ordered some of
his attendants who had the entr&eacute;e at feasts and assemblies to
shoot with arrows. Most shot well. Among them Muh&#803;ammad Y&#363;suf
(qar&#257;wul), shot an arrow which went through two boars, and those
who were standing by broke out without control into applause. At the
time K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam took his leave, he seized him in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>embrace of honour, and showed him great
affection. After he had left the city, he went to his halting-place,
and made many apologies and bade him farewell. As for the beautiful and
costly things that the K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam brought, it was
indeed the assistance of his destiny that gave such rare things into
his hand. Among them was the picture of the fight of &#7778;&#257;hib
Qir&#257;n (T&#299;m&#363;r) with Tuqtamis&#863;h K., and the
likenesses of him and his glorious children and the great Amirs who had
the good fortune to be with him in that fight, and near each figure was
written whose portrait it was. In this picture there were 240 figures.
The painter had written his name as K&#863;hal&#299;l M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h&#299; (in the MS. it is Savaj and not
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h&#299;). The work was very complete and grand,
and resembled greatly the paint-brush of Ust&#257;d Bihz&#257;d. If the
name of the painter had not been written, the work would have been
believed to be his. As it was executed before Bihz&#257;d&rsquo;s date
it is probable that the latter was one of K&#863;hal&#299;l
M&#299;rz&#257;&rsquo;s pupils, and had adopted his style. This
precious relic had been obtained from the illustrious library of
S&#863;h&#257;h Ism&#257;&#703;&#299;l (the 1st), or had come to my
brother S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s from S&#863;h&#257;h
T&#804;ahm&#257;sp. A person of the name of &#7778;&#257;diq&#299;, a
librarian of his, had stolen it, and sold it to someone. By chance (the
painting) fell into the hands of K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam at
Isfahan. The Shah heard that he had found such a rare prize, and asked
it of him on the pretence of looking at it. K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam tried to evade this by artful stratagems, but when he
repeatedly insisted on it, he sent it to him. The Shah recognized it
immediately he saw it. He kept it by him for a day, but at last, as he
knew how great was our liking for such rarities, he&mdash;God be
praised&mdash;made no request<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3542src" href=
"#xd24e3542" name="xd24e3542src">66</a> whatever for it, but told the
facts of the case (about its being stolen) to K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, and made the picture over to him.</p>
<p class="par">At the time when I sent K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam
to Persia, I had sent with him a painter of the name of Bis&#863;han
D&#257;s, who was unequalled in his age for taking likenesses, to take
the portraits of the Shah and the chief men of his State, and bring
them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>He had drawn the likenesses of most of them, and
especially had taken that of my brother the Shah exceedingly well, so
that when I showed it to any of his servants, they said it was
exceedingly well drawn.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day Q&#257;sim K., with the Bakhshi and
Diwan of Lahore, had the good fortune to do homage. Bis&#863;han
D&#257;s, the painter, was honoured with the gift of an elephant.
B&#257;b&#257; K&#863;hw&#257;ja, who was one of the auxiliaries of
Qandahar, was accorded the mansab of 1,000 personal and 550 horse. On
Tuesday, the 3rd, <i>Mad&#257;ru-l-mah&#257;mm&#299;</i> (centre of
important affairs) I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula made ready his army.
Inasmuch as the charge of the Panjab is entrusted to his agents, and he
has also various jagirs in Hindustan, he held a review of 5,000
horsemen. As the area of Kashmir is not such that its produce may
suffice for the expenses of the force that is always on service with
the servants of the army of prosperity, and as, in consequence of the
report (of the approach) of the glorious and victorious standards, the
price of grains and vegetables had risen very high, an order was given,
for the comfort of the public, that those servants who were in
attendance on the royal stirrup should arrange their retinues, and only
taking with them those who were indispensable, should send the
remainder to their jagirs, and in the same way should take every
precaution to reduce as far as possible the number of their beasts and
followers. On Thursday, the 10th, my fortunate son,
S&#863;h&#257;h-Jah&#257;n returned from Lahore, and had the good
fortune to do homage. Having honoured Jah&#257;ng&#299;r Qul&#299; K.
with a dress of honour, a horse and an elephant, I gave him leave to
proceed with his brothers and sons to the Deccan. On this day
T&#804;&#257;lib &#256;mul&#299; received the title of
<i>Maliku-s&#863;h-s&#863;hu&#703;ar&#257;</i> (king of poets), and was
clothed in a dress of honour. His origin was from &#256;mul. For some
time he was with I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula. As the merits of his style
surpassed that of his contemporaries, he was enrolled among the poets
of the throne. The following couplets are by him: <span class=

early youth he went to Kashmir clothed as an ascetic and calendar, and
from the beauty of the place and the pleasantness of the climate set
his heart on the country and settled there. After the conquest of
Kashmir he joined the service of the late king (Akbar), and became
enrolled among the servants of the Presence. His age is now nearly 100

<p class="par">As it was reported to me that in Lahore one Miy&#257;n
S&#863;haik&#863;h Muh&#803;ammad M&#299;r by name, who was a Darvish,
a Sind&#299; by origin, very eloquent, virtuous, austere, of auspicious
temperament, a lord of ecstasy, had seated himself in the corner of
reliance upon God and retirement, and was rich in his poverty and
independent of the world, my truth-seeking mind was not at rest without
meeting him, and my desire to see him increased. As it was impossible
to go to Lahore, I wrote a note to him, and explained to him the desire
of my heart, and that saint, notwithstanding his great age and
weakness, took the trouble to come. I sate with him for a long time
alone, and enjoyed a thorough interview with him. Truly he is a noble
personage, and in this Age he is a great gain and a delightful
existence. This suppliant for Grace was taken out of himself by
companionship with him,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3641src" href=

words of truth and religious knowledge. Although I desired to make him
some gift, I found that his spirit was too high for this, and so did
not express my wish. I left him the skin of a white antelope to pray
upon, and he immediately bade me farewell and went back to Lahore.</p>

"pb120">120</a>]</span>who had a moustache and a thick beard as big as
the hilt of a sword. Her appearance was like that of a man. There was
hair in the middle of her chest as well, but she had no
breasts.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3648src" href="#xd24e3648" name=
"xd24e3648src">72</a> I discovered by her appearance that she ought not
to have children. I told some women to take her aside and examine her,
as perhaps she might be a hermaphrodite. They found she was in no way
different from other women. I have recorded this in this volume on
account of its strangeness.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 24th, B&#257;qir K., having come from
Multan, had the good fortune to pay his respects. In the preceding
pages it has been recorded that All&#257;h-d&#257;d, s.
Jal&#257;l&#257; T&#257;r&#299;k&#299;, had deserted from the
victorious army and taken the road to ruin. He now repented, and
through B&#257;qir K. petitioned I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula for pardon.
At the latter&rsquo;s request I ordered that if he repented of what he
had done, and turned his face in hope towards the Court, his crimes
would be forgiven. On this day B&#257;qir K. brought him to Court, and
at the intercession of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, the traces of
disgrace and the dust of sorrow were washed off his forehead with the
pure water of pardon. Sangr&#257;m, Zamindar of Jammu, was honoured
with the title of Raja and the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse,
and was exalted with the gift of an elephant and a dress of honour.
G&#863;hairat K., faujd&#257;r of the D&#363;-&#257;b, was promoted to
the mansab of 800 personal and 500 horse. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Q&#257;sim
received the rank of 700 and 250 horse, and Taham-tan Beg, s.
Q&#257;sim Koka, received that of 500 personal and 300 horse. I gave
K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam a private elephant with trappings. From
this stage, having given B&#257;qir K. the mansab of 1,500 personal and
500 horse, I dismissed him again to his Subadarship.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 28th, I pitched in the pargana of
Karoh&#299;, which is on the bank of the Bihat (Jhelam). As this hilly
country is one of the established hunting-places, the huntsmen,
according to order, had come on in advance and prepared a <i>jarga</i>
(ring in which game is enclosed). On Wednesday, the 1st of the Divine
month of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, they drove <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>in
the game from six koss. On Thursday, the 2nd, they brought them into
the enclosure, where 101 head of mountain sheep and gazelles were
taken. As Mah&#257;bat K. had been prevented from the good fortune of
coming before me for a long time, I ordered, at his request, that if he
was satisfied with the order of affairs, and was not troubled with
regard to any occurrence, he should leave his forces at their posts
(<i>th&#257;nas</i>), and come to Court unattended. On this day he had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold, and presented 100 muhars as
nazar. K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam was promoted to the mansab of
5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. About this time a written report came
from N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; that he had repaired the P&#363;nch
road, and levelled the defiles as far as possible, but that snow fell
for some days and nights, and lay on the <i>kot&#257;ls</i> to the
depth of three cubits. It was still falling, and if I would delay
outside the hills for a month, I could cross by that route, otherwise
it appeared difficult. As my intention in this undertaking was to see
the spring and the sprouting of bloom, my chance of seeing this was
lost by this delay, and I necessarily turned my rein, and the royal
standards proceeded by the way of Pakl&#299; and Damt&#363;r. On
Friday, the 3rd, I crossed the River Bihat (Jhelam), although the water
was waist-deep. As it was running very fast, and men crossed with great
trouble, I ordered them to take 200 elephants to the fords, and cross
the effects of the people over, and take across as well those who were
weak and feeble, so that there might be no loss of life or goods.</p>
<p class="par">On this day news arrived of the death of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n. He was one of the old servants, and from
the time when I was prince. Although at last he left my service, and
was for some time in that of my father, yet as he had not gone to any
strange place, this did not weigh heavily on my mind. Accordingly,
after my accession, I did him such kindness as he had never conceived
possible, and gave him the mansab of 5,000 personal and 3,000 horse. I
take this opportunity to record in this volume an account of his
idiosyncrasy. He became practised in great affairs and acquired a
wonderful skill in business. His capabilities were the result of
labour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>and he was void of natural ability, and of the
other qualities which are the adornment of men&rsquo;s nature. On this
journey he suffered from heart-failure, but for some days, in spite of
illness and breakdown, he kept up with the march. When his weakness
increased, he was allowed to go back at Kal&#257;naur, and went to
Lahore, and there died a natural death.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3670src" href="#xd24e3670" name="xd24e3670src">73</a></p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 4th of the aforesaid month, the camp
was pitched at the Fort of Roht&#257;s (in the Panjab). I favoured
Q&#257;sim K. with a horse, a sword, and a special shawl
(<i>parm-narm</i>, literally very soft, and Akbar&rsquo;s name for a
shawl, see Blochmann, 90). I gave him leave to go to Lahore. There was
a small garden by the roadside, and I inspected the blossoms.</p>
<p class="par">At this stage <i>t&#299;h&#363;</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd24e3685src" href="#xd24e3685" name="xd24e3685src">74</a> were
obtained. The flesh of the <i>t&#299;h&#363;</i> is better than that of
the partridge (<i>kabak</i>).</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 5th, M. H&#803;asan s. M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam, was promoted to the rank of 1,000 with 400 horse, and was
appointed to the Deccan. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
&#703;Abdu-l-Lat&#804;&#299;f, the chief fowler, also received the rank
of 1,000 with 400 horse. At this place I saw a flower, white inside,
and red outside, while some of them were red inside and yellow outside.
In Persian they call it <i>La&#703;la-i-b&#299;g&#257;na</i>, and in
Hind&#299; <i>thal kanal</i>. <i>Thal</i> means land, and as the lotus
(kanal) is an aquatic plant, they have called this land-lotus.<a class=

<p class="par">On Thursday, the 9th, a report came from Dil&#257;war
K., Governor of Kashmir, containing the good news of the conquest of
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r. Details will be recorded by the pen of the
newswriter after he (Dil&#257;war) comes to the foot of the throne. I
sent him a gracious farman with a special dress of honour and a
jewelled dagger, and granted him the revenue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>of
the conquered province for a year, as a reward for this acceptable
service. On Tuesday, the 14th, I halted at H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l. As
the occurrences on this road and particulars of the stages have been
related in detail in the account of the expedition to Kabul, I shall
not repeat them. From this place as far as Kashmir, they will be
written stage by stage, please Almighty God. From the date on which,
disembarking from a boat, I reached Akbarpur in safety and prosperity,
up to H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l, a distance of 178 koss, I took 69 days in
48 marches and 21 halts.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3721src" href=
"#xd24e3721" name="xd24e3721src">76</a> As at this place there is a
spring full of water, and a cascade, and a very beautiful reservoir, I
halted here two days, and on Thursday, the 16th
(Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;), the feast of my lunar weighing took place.
The 53rd year, according to lunar calculation, of this suppliant at the
throne commenced auspiciously. As beyond this stage, hills, passes, and
many ups and downs were before us, the passage of the camp appeared a
difficult matter, and it was settled that H. M.
Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n&#299; and the other Begams should delay for some
days, and come on at leisure. Mad&#257;ru-l-mulk
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula al-K&#863;h&#257;q&#257;n&#299;,
&#7778;&#257;diq K. Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, and Ir&#257;dat K.
M&#299;r-S&#257;m&#257;n, with the directors of the buildings and other
offices, should attend to their transit. At the same time Rustam
M&#299;rz&#257; &#7778;afaw&#299;, K&#863;h&#257;n-A&#703;z&#804;am,
and a number of other servants, obtained leave to go by the P&#363;nch
road, while the royal retinue went on with some privileged courtiers
(<i>manz&#804;&#363;r&#257;n-i-bis&#257;t&#804;-i-qarb</i>) and the
necessary servants. On Friday, the 17th, we marched 3&frac12; koss, and
halted at the village of Sultanpur.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3727src"
href="#xd24e3727" name="xd24e3727src">77</a> On this day came the news
of the death of R&#257;n&#257; Amar Singh, who had died a natural death
at Udaipur (become a traveller on the road of non-existence). Jagat
Singh, his grandson, and Bh&#299;m,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3730src"
href="#xd24e3730" name="xd24e3730src">78</a> his son, who were in
attendance on me, were presented with dresses of honour, and an order
was given that R&#257;ja Kis&#863;han D&#257;s should proceed with a
gracious farman conferring the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"
href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>title of R&#257;n&#257;, a
dress of honour, a horse, and a private elephant for Kun&#257;r Karan,
to perform the dues of condolence and congratulation. I heard<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3736src" href="#xd24e3736" name=
"xd24e3736src">79</a> from people of this country that when it is not
the rainy season, and there is no sign of a cloud or lightning, a noise
like the voice of the clouds comes from this hill, which they called
Garj (thunder). This noise is heard every year or at least every two
years. I had repeatedly heard of this also when I was in attendance on
the late king. I have written this as it is not devoid of
strangeness,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3739src" href="#xd24e3739"
name="xd24e3739src">80</a> but wisdom is from Allah. On Saturday, the
18th, marching 4&frac12; koss, I halted at the village of Sanj&#299;.
From this stage I entered the pargana of Haz&#257;ra
Q&#257;rlug&#863;h.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3742src" href=
"#xd24e3742" name="xd24e3742src">81</a> On Sunday, the 19th, marching
3&frac34; koss, I halted at the village of Naus&#863;hahra.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3745src" href="#xd24e3745" name=
"xd24e3745src">82</a> From this place we entered Dhant&#363;r. As far
as the eye could reach there were green meadows<a class="noteref" id=

interspersed with the <i>thal-kanwal</i> (hibiscus) and other flowers
in bloom. It was a very beautiful sight. On Monday, the 20th, marching
3&frac12; koss, the camp was pitched at the village of Salhar.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3757src" href="#xd24e3757" name=
"xd24e3757src">84</a> Mah&#257;bat K. presented as offerings jewels and
inlaid vessels to the value of Rs. 60,000. In this country I saw a
flower of the redness of fire, of the shape of
<i>gul-i-k&#863;hatm</i>&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3763src"
href="#xd24e3763" name="xd24e3763src">85</a> but smaller, and several
flowers blooming together in one place, looked from a distance as if
they were one flower. Its stem is of the size of the apricot-tree. On
the hill-slopes here there are many wild violets,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3766src" href="#xd24e3766" name="xd24e3766src">86</a> with a very
sweet scent, but paler than the violet. On Tuesday, the 21st, marching
3 koss, I halted at the village of M&#257;lgall&#299;.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e3769src" href="#xd24e3769" name=
"xd24e3769src">87</a> On this day I dismissed Mah&#257;bat K. to his
duty in Bangash, and conferred <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>on him a special elephant and
dress of honour with a <i>p&#363;st&#299;n</i> (sheepskin coat). This
day there was a drizzling rain till the end of the march. On the eve of
Wednesday, the 22nd, also there was rain. In the morning snow fell, and
as most of the roads had become very slippery, the weak animals fell in
every place, and could not rise again, and 25 of my own elephants were
lent to assist<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3778src" href="#xd24e3778"
name="xd24e3778src">88</a> them. I halted for two days on account of
the snow. On Thursday, the 23rd, Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain,
Zamindar of Pakli, had the good fortune to pay his respects: this is
the entrance to the Pakli country. It is a strange thing that when H.
M. Akbar came here it snowed at this stage, and it has now snowed as
well. For many years no snow has fallen, and there has even been little
rain. On Friday, the 24th, I marched 4 koss and pitched at the village
of Saw&#257;dnagar.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3795src" href=
"#xd24e3795" name="xd24e3795src">89</a> On this road, too there was
much mud.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3798src" href="#xd24e3798" name=
"xd24e3798src">90</a> Apricot and peach trees were blooming on all
sides, and fir-trees like cypresses rejoiced the eye. On Saturday, the
25th, having marched nearly 3&frac12; koss, the camp was pitched near
Pakli. On Sunday, the 26th, I rode out to hunt partridges
(<i>kabak</i>), and at the end of the day, at the request of
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain, went to his house, and increased his
dignity among his equals and neighbours. H. M. Akbar had also gone to
his house. He offered several kinds of horses, daggers, hawks, and
falcons. I presented him with the horses and daggers. I ordered the
hawks and falcons to be got ready<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3810src"
href="#xd24e3810" name="xd24e3810src">91</a> (<i>kamar bar basta</i>),
and shown everything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>that might fly up. The Sarkar of Pakli is
35 koss in length and 25 in breadth. On the east, on two sides, is the
hill country of Kashmir; on the west, Atak Benares (Atak); on the
north, Kator; and on the south, the Gakkar country. At the time when
Timur, after conquering Hindustan, turned his rein backwards towards
the capital of T&#363;r&#257;n, they say that he placed in these
regions this body of people, who were in attendance on the victorious
stirrup. They say themselves that they are Q&#257;rlughs, but do not
know for certain who was their leader at that time. In fact, they are
pure L&#257;haur&#299;s, and speak the same language. The people of
Dhant&#363;r think the same thing. In the time of my father, one of the
name of S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h was Zamindar of Dhant&#363;r; now it
is Bah&#257;dur, his son. Although they are all related to one another,
there are always disputes, as is usual with Zamindars, about
boundaries. They have always been loyal. Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d, the father of Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain and
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, both came to wait on me when I was prince.
Although Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain is seventy years old, to all
outward appearance there is no diminution in his powers, and he can
still ride and be as active as possible. In this country they make
<i>b&#363;za</i> (a beverage) from bread and rice, which they call
<i>sar</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3827src" href="#xd24e3827" name=
"xd24e3827src">92</a> It is much stronger than <i>b&#363;za</i>, and
the older it is the better. This <i>sar</i> is their chief sustenance.
They put this <i>sar</i> into a jar, and fastening it up, keep it for
two or three years in the house. Then they take off the scum and call
the liquor <i>&#257;chh&#299;</i>. The <i>&#257;chh&#299;</i> can be
kept for ten years, and according to them, the older it is the better,
and the shortest time in which they use it is a year. Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d used to take cup after cup of this <i>sar</i>; nay!
he would drink a jar of it. Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain is also
addicted to it, and brought me some of his choicest quality. I took
some in order to try it. I had also drunk it before. Its intoxicating
effects are aphrodisiac, but its taste is harsh. It appeared that they
mix some <i>bh&#257;ng</i> (bang) with it, which increases its
intoxicating power. If there were no wine, it could in case of
necessity be used as a substitute. The fruits are apricots, peaches,
and pears (?) (amr&#363;d). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>As they do not cultivate them, but
they spring up of themselves, they are harsh-flavoured and unpleasant.
Their blossoms are a joy. Their houses are of wood, and are built after
the Kashmiri fashion. They have hawks, and horses, camels, cattle, and
buffaloes, and many goats and fowls. Their mules are small and are not
fit for heavy loads. As it was represented to me that some stages
farther on the cultivation was not such as to provide sufficient grain
for the royal camp, I gave an order that they should only take a small
advanced camp, sufficient for our needs and the necessary
establishments, and diminish the number of elephants, and take with
them provisions for three or four days; that they should take with them
only some of the immediate attendants on the royal stirrup, and that
the rest of the men should come on some stages behind under the command
of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the Bakhshi. In spite of
precautions and injunctions, it was found necessary to have 700
elephants for the advanced camp and the establishments.</p>
<p class="par">The mansab of Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain was 400
personal and 300 horse; I now promoted him to 600 personal and 350
horse, and conferred on him a robe of honour, a jewelled dagger, and an
elephant. Bah&#257;dur Dhant&#363;r&#299; was an auxiliary of the army
of Bangash. An order was given that he should hold the mansab, original
and increased, of 200 personal and 100 horse. On Wednesday, the 27th,
having marched 5&frac14; koss, and crossing by bridges the
Nainsukh,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3861src" href="#xd24e3861" name=
"xd24e3861src">93</a> I chose a halting-place. This Nainsukh (repose of
the eyes) flows from the North, and comes down from the hills of
D&#257;rd<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3864src" href="#xd24e3864" name=
"xd24e3864src">94</a> (?), which is between the country of Badakhshan
and Tibet. As at this place it forms two branches, they had, according
to order, prepared two wooden bridges for the crossing of the
victorious army, one 18 cubits and the other 14 cubits in length, with
a breadth each of 5 cubits. The way in which they make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>bridges in this country is to throw
pine-trees<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3869src" href="#xd24e3869" name=
"xd24e3869src">95</a> on the surface of the water, and fasten the two
ends strongly to rocks, and having thrown on to these<a id="xd24e3878"
name="xd24e3878"></a> thick planks of wood, make them firm with pegs
and ropes, and these, with a little repair, last for years. Briefly,
they made the elephants ford, whilst the horsemen and foot passed over
by the bridge. Sult&#804;&#257;n Mah&#803;m&#363;d called this river
Nainsukh&mdash;that is, &ldquo;Repose of the eye.&rdquo; On Thursday,
the 30th, having marched about 3&frac12; koss, a halt was made on the
bank of the Kis&#863;han Gang&#257;. On this road there is a
<i>kotal</i> of great height, the ascent being 1 koss, and the descent
1&frac12; koss, which they call <i>P&#299;m darang</i>. The reason for
this name is that in the language of Kashmir they call cotton
(<i>pamba</i>) <i>p&#299;m</i>. As the rulers of Kashmir had placed a
superintendent there, who took duties from loads of cotton, and delay
takes place here for the collection of the duty, it has become known as
the <i>P&#299;m darang</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e3895src" href=
"#xd24e3895" name="xd24e3895src">96</a> (cotton delay). After
traversing the pass, there is a very fine and clear waterfall. Having
drunk my usual cups on the edge of the water in the shade of the trees,
I went on to my halting-place in the evening. There was an old bridge
over this river, 54 yards long and 1&frac12; yards wide, which footmen
crossed by. According to orders, another bridge was prepared parallel
to this, in length 53 yards and breadth 3 yards. As the water was deep
and swift, they took the elephants across without loads, and the
footmen and horses crossed by the bridge. By order of my father, a very
strong saray of stone and lime was erected on the top of the ridge
overlooking the river. One day before New Year&rsquo;s Day we had sent
Mu&#703;tamid K. forward to select a spot for the placing of the throne
and preparing the New Year&rsquo;s entertainment. This had to be lofty
and choice. By chance, as he crossed the bridge, there was a ridge
overlooking the water, green and pleasant. On the top of this was a
flat place of 50 cubits which one might say <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>the
rulers of fate had specially prepared for such a day. The aforesaid
officer had made ready everything necessary for the New Year&rsquo;s
feast on the top of that ridge, which was much approved. Mu&#703;tamid
K. was much applauded for this. The river Kis&#863;han Gang&#257; comes
from the south<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3901src" href="#xd24e3901"

Luqm&#257;n is the Eastern &AElig;sop, and there is much about him in
D&rsquo;Herbelot. In the second line the word translated
&ldquo;hollow&rdquo; is <i>gul&#363;g&#257;h</i>, literally
&ldquo;throat place,&rdquo; and the word for bosom is <i>s&#299;na</i>,
the whole expression being <i>s&#299;na-i-chang</i>. Chang is a harp or
lyre, and apparently the expression refers to the narrowness of the
space between the horns of a lyre (<i>chang</i>, which appears to be
the Jew&rsquo;s harp), or the sides of a harp. The fourth line is
obscure, and the version in text seems corrupt. The words
<i>s&#863;has&#863;h bidast d&#363; p&#257;y</i> seem unintelligible.
They, however, occur in I.O. MS. 181, f. 161a, and in I.O. MS. 305, f.
225<i>a</i>. The only difference is that they have a conjunction after
<i>bidast</i>. On the other hand, the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, which
inserts the lines into the record of the eleventh year, has, at p. 95,
a different reading for the fourth line. The words there are
<i>k&#863;h&#257;na yak bidast u sih pay</i>. <i>Bidast</i> is given in
Richardson, and the Farhang-i-Ras&#863;h&#299;d&#299; as meaning a
span, so the line as given in the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma may mean 3 feet
and 1 span. The author of the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma was so struck with
the verse of H&#803;ak&#299;m San&#257;&#702;&#299; and the appearance
of Jadr&#363;p&rsquo;s dwelling, that he composed a
<i>mas&#804;nav&#299;</i> on the subject, which he gives at pp. 95, 96.
There is a third version in Daulat S&#863;h&#257;h&rsquo;s anthology,
p. 97 of Professor Browne&rsquo;s edition. There, in the second line
we<a id="xd24e3214" name="xd24e3214"></a> have <i>h&#803;alqa</i>
(&ldquo;ring&rdquo;), or perhaps &ldquo;plectrum&rdquo; instead of
<i>s&#299;na</i>. We have also two lines not given in the T&#363;zuk or
the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, and the line containing the noodle&rsquo;s
question is given thus: &ldquo;K&#299;n chih j&#257;yast yak p&#363;st

be <i>bad-pus&#863;ht</i> (&ldquo;bad-backed&rdquo;), or it may be

an obscure passage, and Jadr&#363;p&rsquo;s reference to the mention of
<i>d&#257;ms</i> in the Vedas is curious, for <i>d&#257;m</i> is said
to be derived from the Greek drachma. However, it appears from the
&#256;y&#299;n (Blochmann, 31), that the dam, though in value only the
fortieth part of a rupee, weighed 5 <i>t&#257;nks</i> or 1
<i>tol&#257;</i>, 8 <i>m&#257;s&#863;has</i>, 7 <i>surk&#863;hs</i>.
The rupee, we are told there, weighed 11&frac12;
mashas&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, half a masha less than a tola. Consequently
the dam weighed over 20 mashas, and so was not far from being equal in
weight to 2 rupees. The weight of a seer varied, and it may be 30 or 36
copper dams were reckoned as equal to a seer. By dam Jah&#257;ng&#299;r
probably meant <i>pais&#257;</i>, or double <i>pais&#257;</i>.
According to Gladwin, 3&frac12; tanks are by jeweller&rsquo;s weights =

<i>Ta&#7779;adduq s&#863;hud.</i> This is how Mr. Rogers has translated
the passage, and this seems to me to be right. Elliot has
&ldquo;lost,&rdquo; but surely Jah&#257;ng&#299;r would not pass over
so lightly the loss of 25 elephants. <i>Ta&#7779;adduq</i> is often
used in the sense of almsgiving, or of granting a favour. The text 290,
line 2, has <i>aks&#804;ar-i-r&#257;h basta b&#363;d</i>. The word
<i>basta</i> seems unintelligible, and in the corresponding passage of
the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, 135, the words are <i>aks&#804;ar-i-r&#257;h
ajama b&#363;d</i>. This word perhaps means &ldquo;muddy,&rdquo; and

wood, but <i>ajamat</i> means pools as well as woods. Perhaps this is
the same word as occurs in the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, 135, and means

<p class="par first">The transit of the sun, that fulfils the hopes of
the world, into his house of honour in Aries, took place on Friday, the
15th of the month of Rab&#299;&#703;u-s&#804;-s&#804;&#257;n&#299; in
the Hijr&#299; year 1029, (10 March), 1620, after 12&frac12; gharis, or
5 sidereal hours,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3913src" href="#xd24e3913"
name="xd24e3913src">1</a> had passed, and the 15th year of the reign of
this suppliant at the throne of Allah commenced happily and
auspiciously. On Saturday, the 2nd (Farward&#299;n), having marched
4&frac12; koss, I halted at the village of Bakkar. On this road there
was no hill-pass (<i>kotal</i>), but it was rather stony. I saw
peacocks, black partridges, and monkeys (<i>lang&#363;r</i>), such as
exist in the Garms&#299;r country (Afghanistan). It is evident that
these can also exist in cold countries. From this place to Kashmir the
road is along the bank of the river Bihat. There are hills on both
sides, and in the bottom of the valley the water flows with great
force, boiling and raging. However large an elephant may be, he cannot
hold his feet firmly in it, but immediately rolls over, and is carried
away. There are also water-dogs<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3922src"
href="#xd24e3922" name="xd24e3922src">2</a> in the river. On Sunday,
the 3rd, marching 4&frac12; koss, I pitched at M&#363;sar&#257;n. On
the eve of Friday the merchants who live in the pargana of B&#257;ra
M&#363;la came and paid their respects. I asked the reason of the name
of B&#257;ra m&#363;la, and they represented that in the Hindi language
they call a boar <i>B&#257;r&#257;h</i> (<i>Varaha</i>) and m&#363;la
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>a place&mdash;that is, the boars&rsquo; place.
Among the incarnations that belong to the religion of the Hindus, one
is the boar incarnation, and B&#257;r&#257;h m&#363;la by constant use
has become B&#257;ra m&#363;la. On Monday, the 4th, marching 2&frac12;
koss, I pitched at Bh&#363;lb&#257;s. As they said these hills were
very narrow and difficult (to pass), and they could be crossed by a
crowd of men only with great trouble, I gave orders to Mu&#703;tamid K.
that, with the exception of &#256;&#7779;af K. and a few of the
necessary attendants, no one should be allowed to march along with the
prosperous stirrup (with the king personally), and the camp should be
kept one stage behind. By chance, before this order was given, he had
sent on his own tent. After this he wrote to his men that this order
had been given with regard to him, and they should halt at whatever
spot they had reached. His brothers heard this at the foot of the kotal
of Bh&#363;lb&#257;s,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3945src" href=
"#xd24e3945" name="xd24e3945src">3</a> and pitched their own tent
there. When the royal host reached the place, snow and rain began to
fall. One plain of the road had not been crossed when his tent became
visible. Looking on this as a gift from the hidden world, I and the
ladies alighted, and remained protected from the cold and snow and
rain. His brothers, according to orders, sent someone in haste to
summon him. When the news reached him that the elephants and the
advance camp had arrived at the top of the <i>kotal</i>, and blocked up
the road, as it was impossible to ride, <i>with great zeal</i>, he, not
knowing his head from his feet, traversed a distance of 2&frac12; koss
on foot in two hours, and came to wait on me, and repeated this couplet
with the tongue of gesture.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3954src" href=

<p class="par">All that was in his store (<i>bis&#257;t&#804;</i>) in
the way of money and goods, of live stock or dead, he offered for me to
tread upon. I gave them all back, and said: &ldquo;What do worldly
goods appear worth to the eye of our magnanimity? We buy the jewel of
loyalty at a high figure. Such an event arising out of his devotion
should be reckoned as the rising of his good star, in that a king like
me with the people of his harem should remain in his house in comfort
and at ease for a night and a day. It would be a cause of honour to him
among his contemporaries and comrades.&rdquo; On Tuesday, the 5th,
having traversed 2 koss, I alighted at the village of
Kah&#257;&#702;&#299;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3992src" href=
"#xd24e3992" name="xd24e3992src">5</a> I presented the dress (<i>sar u

From this stage we entered within the boundary of Kashm&#299;r. In the
same kotal of Bh&#363;lb&#257;s, Ya&#703;q&#363;b, s. Y&#363;suf K.
Kas&#863;hm&#299;r&#299;, fought with the victorious army of my father,
of which R&#257;ja Bhagw&#257;n D&#257;s, father of R&#257;ja M&#257;n
Singh, was the leader.</p>
<p class="par">On this day, the news came that Suhr&#257;b K., s.
Rustam M&#299;rz&#257;, had been drowned in the Jhelam. The details are
as follows: He, according to orders, was coming up one stage in the
rear, and on the road it came into his mind that he would have a bathe
in the river, though warm water was ready. The people forbade him, and
said that when the air was so cold, unnecessarily to get into a river
so agitated and bloodthirsty that it would roll over a war-elephant,
was contrary to the dictates of caution. He was not restrained by their
words, and as the unavoidable destined time had arrived, got in. From
excessive self-will and pride and carelessness, in reliance on his
powers of swimming, in which art he was unequalled, he was more
determined than ever, and with a <i>k&#863;hidmat&#299;yya</i>
(Blochmann 252) and another servant, both of whom could swim, mounted a
rock on the river bank <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>and threw himself in. Immediately
he fell, from the violent movement of the waves, he could not pull
himself together or try to swim; to fall in and go were the same thing,
and Suhr&#257;b K.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4008src" href=
"#xd24e4008" name="xd24e4008src">7</a> and the
<i>k&#863;hidmat&#299;yya</i> thus gave away the goods of their lives
to the flood of destruction. The boatman,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4014src" href="#xd24e4014" name="xd24e4014src">8</a> with a
hundred difficulties, brought the boat of his being (himself) in safety
to the shore. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam was much attached to this son. On
hearing of this fatal news on the P&#363;nch road, he rent the robe of
patience, and showed great agitation. With all his dependants, clothed
in mourning garments, with head and feet bare, he came to wait on me.
What shall I write of the grief of the mother? Although the
M&#299;rz&#257; has other sons, his heart was bound up in this one. His
age was twenty-six years. In shooting with a gun he was an excellent
pupil of his father, and knew well how to drive elephants and
carriages. On the expedition to Gujarat he was often ordered to ride on
the front part of my private elephant, and he was an active
soldier.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4023src" href="#xd24e4023" name=

<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 6th, marching 3 koss, I pitched at the
village of R&#299;wand. On Thursday, the 7th, crossing the <i>kotal</i>
of Kuw&#257;rmat,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4031src" href="#xd24e4031"
name="xd24e4031src">10</a> which is the most difficult on this road
(MS.), I alighted at the village of Wachaha (MS. and print differ). The
distance of this stage is 4&frac14; koss. The <i>kotal</i> of
Kuw&#257;rmat (Kul&#257;mat in the MS.) is a difficult one, and is the
last of the <i>kotals</i> on the road. On Friday, the 8th, having
traversed nearly 4 koss, I halted at the village of
Balt&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4040src" href="#xd24e4040"
name="xd24e4040src">11</a> There was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>no <i>kotal</i> on
this road. It was broad, and plain after plain, and mead after mead, of
flowers. Sweet-smelling plants of narcissus, violet, and strange
flowers that grow in this country, came to view. Among these flowers I
saw (noticed especially) one extraordinary one. It had five or six
orange flowers blooming with their heads downwards. From the middle of
the flowers there came out some green leaves, as in the case<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4052src" href="#xd24e4052" name=
"xd24e4052src">12</a> of the pineapple (?). This is the

"#xd24e4057" name="xd24e4057src">13</a> flower. There is another flower
like the <i>p&#363;y</i> (?), round which are small flowers of the
shape and colour of the jessamine, some blue in colour and some red,
with yellow points in the middle, exceedingly pretty in appearance: its
name is &ldquo;<i>ladar p&#363;s&#863;h</i>.&rdquo; They call it
<i>p&#363;s&#863;h-i-&#703;aliyyu-l-&#703;um&#363;m</i><a class=

many yellow <i>arg&#863;haw&#257;n</i> (Judas-trees) on the road as
well. The flowers of Kashm&#299;r are beyond counting and calculation.
Which shall I write of? And how many can I describe? I have only
mentioned the most remarkable. There is a waterfall on this road, very
high and fine. It flows down from a high place. No other waterfall of
such beauty was seen on the road. I delayed a moment at it, and filled
my eye and heart with gazing on it from a high spot. On Saturday, the
9th, I marched 4&frac34; koss, and crossed over at
B&#257;ram&#363;la.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4081src" href=

S&#863;hih&#257;bu-d-d&#299;n-p&#363;r. On this day Dil&#257;war K.

light up the foreheads of all my servants with honour.</p>
<p class="par">Kis&#863;htw&#257;r is to the south of Kashmir. From the

S&#863;hahriwar, in my 14th year, Dil&#257;war K., with 10,000 horse
and foot, determined to conquer Kis&#863;htw&#257;r. He appointed his
son, H&#803;asan by name, with Gird &#703;Al&#299;
<i>M&#299;r-bah&#803;r</i> (admiral) to guard the city and administer
the territory. And as Gohar Chak and Aiba Chak laid claim to Kashmir as
heirs, and were stirring up strife in Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, and were
wandering in the valley of confusion and ruin, he left Haibat, one of
his brothers, with a force at Des&#363;, which is near the <i>kotal</i>
of P&#299;r Panj&#257;l, by way of caution, and, dividing his forces at
that place, he himself hastened with a force by the road of
Sang&#299;np&#363;r, sending his son Jal&#257;l, with Na&#7779;ru-llah
&#703;Arab, and &#703;Al&#299; Malik Kas&#863;hm&#299;r&#299;, and a
band of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; servants by another road, and his
elder son Jam&#257;l with a band of zealous young men as an advanced
guard to his own force. At the same time he placed two other forces to
move forward on his right and left. As no horses could go on the road,
by way of precaution he took some with him, but left <span class=

girded the belt of duty on their waists, and went up the hills on foot.
The <i>g&#863;h&#257;z&#299;s</i> of the army of Islam fought from post
to post with the ill-fated unbelievers as far as Narkot, which was one
of the enemy&rsquo;s strongholds. There the corps of Jal&#257;l and
Jam&#257;l, which had been sent by different roads, met, and the enemy,
not having the power to oppose them, took to flight. The brave ones who
offered their lives traversed many ups and downs with the courage of
determination, and hastened on to the M&#257;r&#363; river. On the bank
of that river the fire of slaughter was lighted, and the

activity. The ill-fated Aiba Chak, with many of the people of ruin,
were slain. By the death of Aiba the Raja became powerless and without
heart, and took the road of flight, and, crossing by the bridge,
stopped at Bhandarko&#7789;, which is on the other side. A band of the
brave ones (<i>bah&#257;dur&#257;n</i>) quickly advanced, wishing to
cross the bridge. A great fight took place at its head, and some of the
young men attained to martyrdom. In this way for twenty days and nights
the servants of the Court tried to cross the river, and the unbelievers
of darkened fortune did not fail to attack and try to drive them back,
until Dil&#257;war K., after establishing <i>th&#257;nas</i> and
arranging for the commissariat, arrived with his army. The Raja, by way
of stratagem and vulpine trickery, sent his Vakils to Dil&#257;war K.,
and begged that he might send his brother with offerings to the Court,
so that when his offences obtained pardon, and his mind were freed from
fear and trouble, he could also himself proceed to the Court, the
refuge of the world, and kiss the threshold. Dil&#257;war K. did not
lend his ear to these deceitful words, and did not throw away from his
hand the coin of opportunity. He dismissed the envoys of the Raja
without the attainment of their object, and made every exertion to
cross the bridge. His eldest son Jam&#257;l, with a band of the
crocodiles of the sea of bravery and valour, went up the river, and by
bravely swimming it although swollen crossed over, and engaged in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>a fierce battle with the enemy. The devoted
servants of the Court made an attack from the other side, and made
matters tight for these ruined people. These, when they found they had
no longer the strength to oppose them, broke down the planking of the
bridge, and took to flight. The victorious servants made the bridge
strong again, and transported the remainder of the army. Dil&#257;war
K&#863;h&#257;n drew up his forces at Bhandarko&#7789;. From the
aforesaid river (the M&#257;r&#363;) to the Chen&#257;b, which is a
strong support of these unfortunate people, is a distance of two
bow-shots, and on the bank of the Chen&#257;b there is a lofty hill.
The crossing of the water is a difficult matter, and, with a view to
the coming and going of people on foot, they attach strong ropes, and
place planks of the width of a cubit between two ropes, and fasten one
rope&rsquo;s end to the top of the hill, and the other on the other
side of the water. Then they attach two other ropes a <i>gaz</i> higher
than these, that foot-passengers may place their feet on the planks,
and, taking hold of the upper ropes, may descend from the top of the
hill to the bottom, and so cross the river. This bridge they call
<i>zampa</i>, in the language of the people of the hill country.
Wherever they apprehended that a rope bridge might be constructed, they
stationed musketeers and archers and men-at-arms, and so felt secure.
Dil&#257;war K. made rafts (<i>jh&#257;la</i>), and, placing on them
eighty of his valiant young men, sent them across the river at night.
As the water was flowing with great violence, the rafts were carried
down by the flood of destruction, and sixty-eight of these gallant men
were drowned in the sea of non-existence, and obtained the renown of
martyrdom, whilst ten, by the aid of swimming, reached the shore of
safety (<i>i.e.</i>, returned), and two on the other side became
prisoners in the hands of the infidels. In short, for four months and
ten days Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, having planted the foot of
courage at Bhandarko&#7789;, made endeavours to cross over; but the
arrow of stratagem did not reach the target of intent until a Zamindar
pointed out a place which the enemy had no idea of. There, having
constructed a <i>zampah</i>, in the heart of night, Jal&#257;l,
Dil&#257;war K.&rsquo;s son, with some of the servants of the Court and
a band of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>Afghans, about 200 in number, crossed over in
safety, made unawares in the morning an attack on the Raja, and blew
loudly the trumpets of victory. A few who were around and before the
Raja rushed out, bewildered, half asleep and half awake, and most of
them became the harvest of the blood-drinking sword, while the rest
quickly withdrew themselves from that whirlpool of calamity. In that
encounter one of the soldiers came upon the Raja, and wished to finish
him with a sword. He called out: &ldquo;I am the Raja; take me alive to
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n.&rdquo; The men rushed on him and made him
prisoner. After the Raja was made prisoner, his people all fled. When
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n heard this good news of victory, he
prostrated himself in thankfulness to Allah, and, having crossed the
river with the victorious army, came to Mandal Badr,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e4154src" href="#xd24e4154" name="xd24e4154src">21</a> which
was the capital of the country, and is 3 koss from the river. The
daughter<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4157src" href="#xd24e4157" name=
"xd24e4157src">22</a> of Sangr&#257;m Raja of Jammu, and the daughter
of the abandoned S&#363;raj Mal, s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, were in the
Raja&rsquo;s house (<i>i.e.</i>, married to him). By
Sangr&#257;m&rsquo;s daughter he had children. Before the victory he
had, by way of caution, sent his family for refuge to the Raja of
Jasw&#257;l and other Zamindars. When my victorious retinue approached,
Dil&#257;war K&#863;h&#257;n, according to order, took the Raja with
him, and came to kiss the threshold, leaving Na&#7779;ru-llah
&#703;Arab with a body of horse and foot to guard the country.</p>
<p class="par">In Kis&#863;htw&#257;r there are produced much wheat,
barley, lentils, millet, and pulse. Differing from Kashmir, it produces
little rice. Its saffron is finer than that of Kashmir. About a hundred
hawks and falcons are caught there (annually). Oranges, citrons, and
water-melons of the finest kind are obtained. Its melons are of the
same kind as those of Kashmir, and other fruits, such as grapes,
apricots, peaches, and sour pears, are grown. If they were cultivated,
it is possible they would improve. A coin<a class="noteref" id=

of <i>sanhas&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4172src" href=
"#xd24e4172" name="xd24e4172src">24</a> is a relic of the old rulers of
Kashmir, one and a half of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139"
href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>equal a rupee. In their
business transactions they reckon fifteen <i>sanhas&#299;</i>, or ten
rupees, as one <i>p&#257;ds&#863;h&#257;h&#299;</i> muhar. They call
two seers of Hindustani weight a <i>man</i> (maund). It is not the
custom for the Raja to take revenue from cultivation; he takes annually
six <i>sanhas&#299;</i>&mdash;that is, four rupees&mdash;from each
house. All the saffron is assigned, as pay, to a body of Rajputs and to
700 musketeers (<i>t&#363;pch&#299;</i>) who are old retainers. When
the saffron is sold, four rupees per maund, or two seers, are taken
from the purchaser. The whole income of the Raja consists of fines, and
for a small offence he takes a heavy sum. From whomsoever is wealthy
and in comfortable circumstances the Raja, on some pretext, clears out
all that he has. From all sources his income is about Rs. 100,000. In
time of war 6,000 or 7,000 men on foot collect together; there are but
few horses among them. The Raja and the chief men have about fifty
between them. I bestowed a year&rsquo;s revenue on Dil&#257;war K. by
way of reward. By conjecture, his jagir was worth about 1,000 personal
and 1,000 horse, according to the <i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;</i>
rules. When the chief diwans calculate the allowances to the jagirdars,
the exact amount will be ascertained.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 11th, after two watches and four gharis
had passed, the royal cortege alighted auspiciously and happily at the
buildings lately erected on the bank of the lake (the Dal lake). By
order of my father, a very strong fort of stone and lime had been
built. It is not quite completed, one side being unfinished. It is
hoped that hereafter it will be completed. From H&#803;asan Abd&#257;l
to Kashmir by the road I came is a distance of 75 koss; this was
accomplished in nineteen marches and six halts&mdash;that is, in
twenty-five days. From Agra to Kashmir, in the space of 168 days, a
distance of 376 koss was traversed in 102 marches and 63 halts. By
land<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4204src" href="#xd24e4204" name=
"xd24e4204src">25</a> and the ordinary route the distance is
304&frac12; koss.</p>
<p class="par">On Tuesday, the 12th, Dil&#257;war K., according to
order, brought the Raja<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4209src" href=
"#xd24e4209" name="xd24e4209src">26</a> of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r,
chained, into my presence, and did homage. He (the Raja) is not wanting
in dignity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>His dress is after the Indian fashion, and he
knows both the Hindi and the Kashmiri languages. Contrary to other
Zamindars of these regions, he looked like the inhabitant of a town. I
told him that, notwithstanding his offences, if he would bring his sons
to Court, he should be released from confinement, and might live at
ease under the shadow of the eternal State, or else he would be
imprisoned in one of the forts of Hindustan. He said that he would
bring his people, his family, and his sons to wait on me, and was
hopeful of my clemency.</p>
<p class="par">I shall now give a brief account of the country of
Kashmir and of its peculiarities.</p>
<p class="par">Kashmir<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4219src" href=
"#xd24e4219" name="xd24e4219src">27</a> belongs to the fourth climate.
Its latitude is 35&deg; N., and its longitude, from the White Islands,
105&deg;. In old times the country was in the possession of Rajas.
Their dynasty lasted for 4,000 years. An account of them, and a list of
their names, are given in the R&#257;ja-tarang, which, by my
father&rsquo;s order, was translated<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4234src" href="#xd24e4234" name="xd24e4234src">28</a> from the
Sanskrit (Hindi in text) into Persian. In the Hijr&#299; year 712
(1312&ndash;13) Kashmir was illumined by the religion of Islam.
Thirty-two Muhammadan princes reigned over it for 282 years, until, in
994 (1586), my father conquered it. From that date till now, being a
period of thirty-five years, the country has been in the possession of
the Crown. Kashmir, from the Pass of B&#363;l&#299;y&#257;sa<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4237src" href="#xd24e4237" name=
"xd24e4237src">29</a> to Qambarbar, is 56
<i>Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299;</i> koss long, and its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>breadth is never more than 27 koss, or less than
10 koss. S&#863;haik&#863;h Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l has, in the
Akbar-n&#257;ma, stated, by guess and conjecture, that the length of
Kashmir from the Kis&#863;han Gang&#257; to Qambarbar is 120 koss, and
its breadth from 10 to 25 koss. I, out of prudence and caution,
appointed a number of trustworthy and intelligent men to measure the
length and breadth with ropes (<i>t&#804;an&#257;b)</i>. The result was
that what the S&#863;haik&#863;h wrote as 120 koss came out as 67. As
it is agreed that the boundary of a country is the place up to which
people speak the language of that country, it follows that the boundary
of Kashmir is B&#363;l&#299;y&#257;sa, which is 11 koss on this side
(<i>i.e.</i>, east) of the Kis&#863;han Gang&#257;. So, according to
the preceding figures, the length of Kashmir is 56 (67 - 11) koss. The
variations in breadth were found to be not more than 2 koss. The
koss<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4254src" href="#xd24e4254" name=
"xd24e4254src">30</a> which is in use during my reign is that
prescribed by my father. That is, a koss is 5,000 yards, and the yard
is 2 <i>s&#863;har&#703;&#299;</i> yards, each of the latter (yards)
being 24 digits<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4307src" href="#xd24e4307"
name="xd24e4307src">31</a> (<i>angus&#863;ht&#804;</i>). Wherever the
koss or <i>gaz</i> is mentioned, the reference is to the above koss and
the above <i>gaz</i>. The name of the city is Sr&#299;nagar, and the
Bihat river flows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>through the midst of it. They call its
fountain-head V&#299;r-n&#257;g.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4325src"
href="#xd24e4325" name="xd24e4325src">32</a> It is 14 koss to the
south. By my order they have made a building and a garden at that
source. There have been built in the city four very strong stone and
wooden bridges, over which people come and go. They call a bridge in
the language of this country <i>kadal</i>. There is a very lofty mosque
in the city, one of the marks of Sult&#804;&#257;n Sikandar,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4331src" href="#xd24e4331" name=
"xd24e4331src">33</a> made in 795 (1393). After a time it was burnt,
but was rebuilt by Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain. It had not been
completed when the mansion of his life fell down. In 909
(1503&ndash;04) Ibr&#257;h&#299;m M&#257;qr&#299;, Vizier of
Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain, finished it handsomely. From that day
till now it is 120 years since it has been in existence. From the
<i>Mih&#803;r&#257;b</i> to the eastern wall it is 145 yards, and its
breadth is 144 yards, containing four (<i>t&#804;&#257;q</i>) alcoves.
On all sides of the hall they have erected beautiful cloisters and
pillars. In short, no better memorial of the rulers of Kashmir has been
left than this. M&#299;r Sayyid &#703;Al&#299; of Hamadan (may his
grave be sanctified!) was for some time in this city. There is a
monastery<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4344src" href="#xd24e4344" name=
"xd24e4344src">34</a> to his memory. Near the city there are
two<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4349src" href="#xd24e4349" name=
"xd24e4349src">35</a> large lakes full of water all the year round.
Their flavour<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4355src" href="#xd24e4355"
name="xd24e4355src">36</a> does not vary; they are the means for coming
and going of the people, and for the conveyance of grain and firewood
on boats. In the city and parganas there are 5,700 boats, with
7,400<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4361src" href="#xd24e4361" name=
"xd24e4361src">37</a> boatmen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>The country of Kashmir has
thirty-eight parganas. It is divided into two provinces; the territory
on the upper part of the river they call <i>Marr&#257;j</i>, and that
on the lower <i>K&#257;mr&#257;j</i>. It is not the custom to use gold
and silver for payment of the revenue from land or in commerce, except
for a portion of the cesses
(<i>s&#257;&#702;ir-jih&#257;t</i>).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4387src" href="#xd24e4387" name="xd24e4387src">38</a> They reckon
the value of things in <i>k&#863;harw&#257;rs</i> of rice, each
<i>k&#863;harw&#257;r</i> being three maunds and eight seers of the
current weight. The Kashmiris reckon two seers as one maund, and four
maunds, or eight seers, make one <i>tark</i>. The revenue of Kashmir is
30,63,050 <i>k&#863;harw&#257;rs</i> and 11 <i>tarks</i>, which in cash
represents 7,46,70,000 <i>d&#257;ms</i>. Ordinarily it maintains 8,500
horse. It is very difficult to enter Kashmir. The routes by
Bhimbhar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4409src" href="#xd24e4409" name=
"xd24e4409src">39</a> and Pakl&#299; are the best. Though that by
Bhimbhar is the shorter, yet if one wishes to find spring in Kashmir,
he is confined to the road by Pakl&#299;, for the other roads at this
season are blocked with snow. If one were to take to praise Kashmir,
whole books would have to be written. Accordingly a mere summary will
be recorded.</p>
<p class="par">Kashmir is a garden<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4414src"
href="#xd24e4414" name="xd24e4414src">40</a> of eternal spring, or an
iron fort to a palace of kings&mdash;a delightful flower-bed, and a
heart-expanding heritage for dervishes. Its pleasant meads and
enchanting cascades are beyond all description. There are running
streams and fountains beyond count. Wherever the eye reaches, there are
verdure and running water. The red rose, the violet, and the narcissus
grow of themselves; in the fields, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144"
href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>there are all kinds of
flowers and all sorts of sweet-scented herbs more than can be
calculated. In the soul-enchanting spring the hills and plains are
filled with blossoms; the gates, the walls, the courts, the roofs, are
lighted up by the torches of banquet-adorning tulips. What shall we say
of these things or of the wide meadows (<i>julgah&#257;</i>) and the

<p class="par first">The finest inflorescence is that of the almond and
the peach. Outside the hill-country the commencement of blossoming is
the 1st Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; (February 10). In the territory of
Kashmir it is 1st Farward&#299;n (March 10), and in the city gardens it
is the 9th and 10th of that month, and the end of their blooming joins
on to the commencement of that of the blue jessamine. In attendance on
my revered father I frequently went round the saffron fields, and
beheld the spectacle of the autumn. Thank God that on this occasion I
beheld the beauties<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4456src" href=
"#xd24e4456" name="xd24e4456src">42</a> of the spring. The beauties of
the autumn shall be described in their place. The buildings of Kashmir
are all of wood; they make them two-, three-, and four-storied, and
covering the roofs with earth, they plant bulbs of the
<i>chaug&#863;h&#257;s&#863;h&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4467src" href="#xd24e4467" name="xd24e4467src">43</a> tulip,
which blooms year after year <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>in the spring season, and is
exceedingly beautiful. This custom is peculiar to the people of
Kashmir. This year, in the little garden<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4478src" href="#xd24e4478" name="xd24e4478src">44</a> of the
palace and on the roof of the chief mosque, the tulips blossomed
luxuriantly. There are many blue jessamines in the gardens, and the
white jessamines that the people of India call
<i>chamb&#299;l&#299;</i> are sweet-scented. Another kind is of the
colour of sandal-wood, and this is also very sweet-scented. This is
special to Kashmir. I saw several sorts of red roses: one is specially
sweet-scented, and another is a flower of the colour of sandal (light
yellow), with an exceedingly delicate scent. It (the scent?) is of the
nature of (that of) the red rose, and its stem is like that of the red
rose. There are two kinds of lilies. That which is grown in gardens is
vigorous <i>(b&#257;l&#299;da)</i> and fresh (lit. green) coloured, the
other is a wild kind. Although the latter has less colour it is very
sweet-scented. The flower of the <i>Ja&#703;far&#299;</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4493src" href="#xd24e4493" name=
"xd24e4493src">45</a> (a yellow flower) is large and sweet-scented; its
stem is above a man&rsquo;s height, but in some years, when it has
grown large and has flowered, a worm is produced, and spreads over the
flower a kind of spider&rsquo;s web, and destroys it and dries up its
stem. This year it has so happened. The flowers that are seen in the
territories of Kashmir are beyond all calculation. Those that

There are pears (<i>n&#257;s&#863;hp&#257;t&#299;</i>) of the best

those of Samarkand. The apples of Kashmir are celebrated for their
goodness. The guavas (<i>amr&#363;d</i>) are middling. Grapes are
plentiful, but most of them are harsh and inferior, and the

"#xd24e4529" name="xd24e4529src">50</a>, but for the most part when
they become ripe a worm is found in them that spoils them. If by chance
they are preserved from this misfortune they are very delicate. There
are no <i>s&#863;h&#257;h-t&#363;t</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4536src" href="#xd24e4536" name="xd24e4536src">51</a> (some kind
of large mulberry), but there are other (<i>t&#363;t</i>) mulberries
everywhere. From the foot of every mulberry-tree a vine-creeper
grows<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4542src" href="#xd24e4542" name=
"xd24e4542src">52</a> up. In fact, the mulberries of Kashmir are not
fit to eat, with the exception of some on trees grown in gardens, but
the leaves are used to feed the silkworm. They bring the
silkworms&rsquo; eggs from Gilgit and Tibet. There is plenty of wine
and vinegar, but the wine is sour and inferior, and in the Kashmir
language is called <i>mas</i>. After they take cups of it some heat of
head ensues. They make various pickles with the vinegar. As the garlic
of Kashmir is good, the best pickle is that of garlic. There are all
kinds of crops except peas. If they sow peas, they give a crop the
first year, in the second they are inferior, and in the third year they
are like <i>mus&#863;hang</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4552src"
href="#xd24e4552" name="xd24e4552src">53</a> Rice is the principal
crop. Probably there are three parts under rice and one under all other
grains. The chief food of the people of Kashmir is rice, but it is
inferior. They boil it fresh,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4560src" href=
"#xd24e4560" name="xd24e4560src">54</a> and allow it to get cold, and
then eat it, and call it <i>batha</i>. It is not usual to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>take
their food warm, but people of small means keep a portion of the
<i>batha</i> for a night, and eat it next day. Salt is brought from
India. It is not the custom to put salt into the <i>batha</i>. They
boil vegetables in water, and throw in a little salt in order to alter
the flavour, and then eat them along with the <i>batha</i>. Those who
want to have something tasty put a little walnut-oil into the
vegetables. Walnut-oil soon becomes bitter and evil-flavoured. They
also use cow-oil (<i>raug&#863;han</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <i>ghi</i>),
but this is taken fresh, and fresh from newly-made butter
(<i>maska</i>). They throw this into the food, and call it
&ldquo;sad&#257;-p&#257;k&rdquo; in the Kashmiri language. As the
atmosphere is cold and damp, it becomes altered by being kept for three
or four days. There are no buffaloes, and the cattle are small and
inferior. The wheat<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4600src" href=
"#xd24e4600" name="xd24e4600src">55</a> is small and of little
substance (<i>kam mag&#863;hz</i>). It is not the custom to eat bread
(<i>n&#257;n</i>). There are tailless sheep, resembling the
<i>kad&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4611src" href="#xd24e4611"
name="xd24e4611src">56</a> (or <i>gadd&#299;</i>) of India. They are
called <i>hand&#363;</i>, and their flesh is not without flavour.
Fowls, geese, and ducks (<i>murg&#863;h&#257;b&#299;</i>)&mdash;golden
and others&mdash;are plentiful. There are all kinds of fish, both with
and without scales, but they are inferior. The woollen cloths are well
known. Men and women wear a woollen tunic (<i>kurt&#257;</i>), and call
it <i>pa&#7789;&#7789;&#363;</i>. If they do not put on a tunic, they
believe that the air affects them, and even that it is impossible to
digest their food without it. The shawls of Kashmir, to which my father
gave the name of <i>parm-narm</i>, are very famous: there is no need to
praise them. Another kind is <i>taharma</i> (<i>naharma</i> in the
printed version); it is thicker than a shawl, and soft.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4671src" href="#xd24e4671" name=
"xd24e4671src">57</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>Another is called <i>darma</i>. It
is like a <i>jul-i-k&#863;hirsak</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4692src" href="#xd24e4692" name="xd24e4692src">58</a> and is put
over carpets. With the exception of shawls they make other woollen
materials better in Tibet. Though they bring the wool for the shawls
from Tibet they do not make them there. The wool for shawls comes from
a goat which is peculiar to Tibet. In Kashmir they weave the
<i>pa&#7789;&#7789;&#363;</i> shawl from wool, and sewing two shawls
together they smooth them into a kind of <i>saqarl&#257;t</i>
(broad-cloth), which is not bad for a rain-coat. The men of Kashmir
shave the head and put on a round turban, and the common women do not
wear clean, washed clothes. They use a tunic of
<i>pa&#7789;&#7789;&#363;</i> for three or four years; they bring it
unwashed from the house of the weaver, and sew it into a tunic, and it
does not reach the water till it falls to pieces. It is considered
wrong to wear drawers (<i>iz&#257;r</i>); they wear the tunic long and
ample as far as the head and falling down to the feet, and they also
wear<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4715src" href="#xd24e4715" name=
"xd24e4715src">59</a> a belt. Although most of the houses are on the
river-bank not a drop of water touches their bodies. In short, they are
as dirty outside as inside, without any cleanliness. In the time of
M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;aidar there were many skilled people there. They
were skilled in music, and their lutes, dulcimers, harps, drums, and
flutes were celebrated. In former times they had a musical instrument
like a lute, and used to sing in the Kas&#863;hm&#299;r&#299; language
compositions according to Hindi musical modes, there being even two or
three modes combined together. Moreover, many sing together in chorus.
In fact, Kashmir is much indebted to M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;aidar for
its excellencies. Before the reign of my father the chief method by
which the people of these parts rode was on <i>g&#363;nts</i> (ponies).
They had no large horses, but used to bring &#703;Ir&#257;q and Turki
horses by way of rare gifts for their rulers. <i>G&#363;nt</i> means a
<i>y&#257;b&#363;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4727src" href=
"#xd24e4727" name="xd24e4727src">60</a> (pony). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>They
have thick shoulders, and are low in the body. They are common in other
of the hill-countries of India. For the most part they are
vicious<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4756src" href="#xd24e4756" name=
"xd24e4756src">61</a> and hard-mouthed. When this God-created
flower-garden acquired eternal beauty under the auspices of the State,
and by the blessing of the teaching of the Alexander-minded
K&#863;h&#257;q&#257;n, many of the Aim&#257;qs (cavalry) were
presented with jagirs in this Subah, and herds of &#703;Ir&#257;q&#299;
and Turk&#299; horses were given them to breed from (<i>kih kurra
bag&#299;rand</i>). The soldiers also brought horses<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e4774src" href="#xd24e4774" name="xd24e4774src">62</a> on their
own account, and in a short time horses were obtainable, so that many
Kashmiri horses were bought and sold for 200 and Rs. 300, and even for
Rs. 1,000.</p>
<p class="par">The merchants and artificers of this country are mostly
Sunnis, while the soldiers are Im&#257;miyya Shias. There is also the
sect of N&#363;r-bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;s.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4794src" href="#xd24e4794" name="xd24e4794src">63</a> There is

they eat no flesh, they have no wives, and always plant fruit-bearing
trees in the fields, so that men may benefit by them, themselves
deriving no advantage. There are about 2,000 of these people. There is
also a body of brahmans living from of old in this country, who still
remain there and talk in the Kashmiri tongue. Outwardly one cannot
distinguish them from Mussulmans. They have, however, books in the
Sanskrit language, and read them. They carry into practice whatever
relates to the worship of idols. Sanskrit is a language in which the
learned of India have composed books, and esteem them greatly. The
lofty idol temples which were built before the manifestation of Islam
are still in existence, and are all built of stones, which from
foundation to roof are large, and weigh 30 or 40 maunds, placed one on
the other. Near the city there is a small hill which they call
K&#363;h-i-M&#257;r&#257;n<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4808src" href=
"#xd24e4808" name="xd24e4808src">65</a> (&ldquo;The Wicked Hill,&rdquo;
Lawrence, 298), as well as Har&#299; Parbat. On the east side of the
hill there is the Dal Lake, which measures round a little more than
6&frac12; koss.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4815src" href="#xd24e4815"
name="xd24e4815src">66</a> My father (may the lights of Allah be his
testimony!) gave an order that they should build in this place a very
strong fort of stone and lime; this has been nearly completed during
the reign of this suppliant, so that the little hill has been brought
into the midst of the fortifications, and the wall of the fort built
round it. The lake is close to the fort, and the palace overlooks the
water. In the palace there was a little garden, with a small building
in it in which my revered father used constantly to sit. At this period
it appeared to me to be very much out of order and ruinous. As it was
the place where that veritable <i>qibla</i> (place turned towards in
prayer) and visible Deity used to sit, and it is really a place of
prostration for this suppliant, therefore its neglected state did not
appear right to me. I ordered Mu&#703;tamid K., who is a servant who
knows my temperament, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>to make every effort to put the
little garden in order and repair the buildings. In a short space of
time, through his great assiduity, it acquired new beauty. In the
garden he put up a lofty terrace 32 yards square, in three divisions
(<i>qit&#804;&#702;a</i>), and having repaired the building he adorned
it with pictures by masterhands, and so made it the envy of the picture
gallery of China. I called this garden <i>N&#363;r-afz&#257;</i> (light
increasing).</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 15th of the Divine month of
Farward&#299;n, two <i>qut&#804;&#257;s</i> oxen, out of the offerings
of the Zamindar of Tibet, were brought before me. In form and
appearance they closely resemble the buffalo. All the limbs are covered
with wool which properly belongs to animals in a cold country. For
instance, the <i>rang</i> goats (ibex), which they brought from the
country of Bhakkar (Sind) and the hill-country of the Garms&#299;r (in
Afghanistan) were very handsome, and had but little wool, and those
that are met with in these hills, on account of the excessive cold and
snow, are covered with hair and ugly. The Kashmiris call the rang
<i>kapal</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4840src" href="#xd24e4840"
name="xd24e4840src">67</a> On this day they brought a musk deer as an
offering. As I had not tasted its flesh, I ordered it to be cooked; it
appeared very tasteless and bad for food. The flesh of no other wild
animal is so inferior. The musk-bag when fresh has no scent, but when
it is left for some days and becomes dry, it is sweet-scented. The
female has no musk-bag. In these two or three days I frequently
embarked in a boat, and was delighted to go<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4849src" href="#xd24e4849" name="xd24e4849src">68</a> round and
look at the flowers of Ph&#257;k and S&#863;h&#257;lam&#257;r.
Ph&#257;k is the name of a pargana situated on the other side of the
lake. S&#863;h&#257;lam&#257;r is near the lake. It has a pleasant
stream, which comes down from the hills, and flows into the Dal Lake. I
bade my son K&#863;hurram dam it up and make a waterfall, which it
would be a pleasure to behold. This place is one of the sights of
Kashmir.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 17th, a strange affair took place.
S&#863;h&#257;h S&#863;huj&#257;&#703; was playing in the buildings of
the palace. By chance there was a window with a screen in front of it
looking towards <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>the river. They had put a screen in front,
but had not fastened the door, and the prince in play went towards the
window to look out. As soon as he arrived there he fell headlong. By
chance they had laid down a carpet below the wall, and a
farr&#257;s&#863;h (carpet-spreader) was sitting near it. The
child&rsquo;s head fell on this carpet, and his feet on the back and
shoulders of the farr&#257;s&#863;h, and so came to the ground. Though
the height was 7 yards<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4856src" href=
"#xd24e4856" name="xd24e4856src">69</a> (<i>dara&#703;</i>), the
compassion of God, the Great and Glorious, came to his aid, and the
carpet and the farr&#257;s&#863;h became the means of saving his life.
God forbid, but if it had not been so it would have been a serious
matter for him. At the time R&#257;y M&#257;n, the head of the
K&#863;hidmatiyya<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4865src" href="#xd24e4865"
name="xd24e4865src">70</a> piy&#257;das, was standing below the
<i>jharoka</i>. He immediately ran and picked him up, and holding him
in his arms, was taking him upstairs. In that condition he asked:
&ldquo;Whither are you carrying me?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Into the
presence of His Majesty.&rdquo; Then weakness overcame him, and he
could speak no more. I was lying down when this alarming news reached
me, and ran out in a state of bewilderment. When I saw him in this
state my senses forsook me, and for a long time holding him in my
affectionate embrace I was distracted with this favour from Allah. When
a child of four years of age falls headlong from a place ten ordinary
(<i>s&#863;har&#703;&#299;</i>) gaz in height, and no harm happens to
his limbs, it is a cause for amazement. Having performed my
prostrations for this fresh act of goodness, I distributed alms, and
ordered that deserving people and the poor who lived in the city should
be brought before me in order that I might assure them their means of
livelihood. A strange thing was that three or four months before this
event Jotik R&#257;y, the astrologer, who is one of the most skilled of
the class in astrology, had represented to me, without any
intermediary, that it was predicted from the Prince&rsquo;s horoscope
that these three or four months were unpropitious to him, and it was
possible he might fall down from some high place, but that the dust of
calamity would not settle on the skirt of his life. As his
prognostications had repeatedly proved correct, this dread dwelt in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>my mind, and on these dangerous roads and
difficult mountain passes I was never for a moment forgetful of that
nursling of the <i>parterre</i> of Fortune. I continually kept him in
sight, and took the greatest precautions with regard to him. When I
arrived in Kashmir this unavoidable<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4880src"
href="#xd24e4880" name="xd24e4880src">71</a> catastrophe occurred. His
nurses (<i>anagah&#257;</i>) and wet-nurses must have been very
careless. God be praised that it ended well!</p>
<p class="par">In the garden of &#703;Ais&#863;h&#257;b&#257;d<a class=

R&#257;ja Sangr&#257;m. On Monday, the 1st of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, I
went to the house of K&#863;hurram, and entered his bath-house, and
when I came out he presented his offerings. Of these I accepted a
trifle in order to please him. On Thursday, the 4th, M&#299;r Jumla was
promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 300 horse. On Sunday, the

the native country of H&#803;aidar Malik, to hunt partridges. In truth
this is a very pleasant spot of ground, and has flowing streams and
lofty plane-trees. At his request I gave it the name of

branches and shakes it, the whole of the tree comes into movement. The
common people believe that this movement is peculiar to that tree. By
chance in the said village I saw another tree of the same kind, which
was in similar movement, and I ascertained that it was common to that
species of tree, and not confined to one tree. In the village of
R&#257;walp&#363;r, 2&frac12; koss from the city towards Hindustan,
there is a plane-tree, burnt in the inside. Twenty-five years before
this, when I myself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155"

saddled horses and two eunuchs, we went inside it. Whenever I had
chanced to mention this people were surprised. This time I again
ordered some of the men to go inside, and what I had in my mind came to
pass in the same manner. It has been noted in the Akbar-n&#257;ma that
my father took<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4941src" href="#xd24e4941"

loyal people, it was shown to me that &#703;Ambar, the black-fated one
(he was an Abyssinian), had again placed his foot beyond the bounds of
good behaviour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>and had, according to his nature, laid a
foundation for trouble and sedition, and as the victorious army had
proceeded to a distant part of the country, he, considering it a good
opportunity, had broken the pledges he had given to the servants of the
Court, and had stretched out his hand to take possession of royal
territory. It is hoped that he will soon be entangled in the disgrace
of his deeds. As he (the Commander-in-Chief) had asked for treasure, it
was ordered that the diwans of Agra should send Rs. 20,00,000 to the
Commander-in-Chief. Close upon this news came that the Amirs had left
their posts, and come together to D&#257;r&#257;b K., and that the
<i>Barg&#299;s</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e4963src" href=
"#xd24e4963" name="xd24e4963src">81</a> (the Mahrattas) were
surrounding his camp, and that K&#863;hanjar K. had taken refuge in
Ah&#803;madnagar. Two or three battles had already taken place between
the rebels and the servants of the Court, and each time the enemy had
been defeated, and many of them killed. On the last occasion
D&#257;r&#257;b K., taking with him well-mounted young men, attacked
the rebels&rsquo; camp. A fierce battle ensued, and the enemy being
defeated turned the face of ruin towards the valley of flight. Their
camp had been plundered, and the victorious army had returned in safety
to their camp. As difficulty and distress had fallen on the victorious
army, those who were loyal came to the conclusion that they should go
down by the Pass of Rohanga&#7771;h<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4966src"
href="#xd24e4966" name="xd24e4966src">82</a> and remain below the
<i>gh&#257;t</i>, so that forage and grain might be easily obtained,
and the men not incur any labour or distress. Having no choice, they
prepared the army of prosperity at B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r, and the
rebels of black fortune, with impertinence and importunity, appeared
near B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r. R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, with some of
the devoted servants, plucking up courage in order to beat back the
enemy, slew many of them. An Abyssinian of the name of
Man&#7779;&#363;r, who was in the rebel army, fell into their hands,
and although they wished to put him on an elephant (see
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma 161, the text wrongly has <i>z&#299;r</i>
&ldquo;under&rdquo;), he would not agree, and was insolent.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4976src" href="#xd24e4976" name=
"xd24e4976src">83</a> R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo ordered them to
separate his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=

circling sphere will lay the recompense of improper deeds on the skirt
of life of all who do not recognize the right.</p>
<p class="par">On the 3rd Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht I rode to see the Sukh
N&#257;g.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4983src" href="#xd24e4983" name=
"xd24e4983src">84</a> It is a beautiful summer residence
(&#299;l&#257;q). This waterfall is in the midst of a valley, and flows
down from a lofty place. There was still ice on its sides. The
entertainment of Thursday was arranged for in that flower-land, and I
was delighted at drinking my usual cups on the edge of the water. In
this stream I saw a bird like a <i>s&#257;j</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e4989src" href="#xd24e4989" name="xd24e4989src">85</a> A
<i>s&#257;j</i> is of a black colour and has white spots, while this
bird is of the same colour as a <i>bulbul</i> with white spots, and it
dives and remains for a long time underneath, and then comes up from a
different place. I ordered them to catch and bring two or three of
these birds, that I might ascertain whether they were waterfowl and
were web-footed, or had open feet like land birds. They caught two and
brought them. One died immediately, and the other lived for a day. Its
feet were not webbed like a duck&rsquo;s. I ordered
N&#257;diru-l-&#703;a&#7779;r Ust&#257;d Man&#7779;&#363;r to draw its
likeness. The Kashmiris call it <i>galkar</i><a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">On this day the Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; and the Chief
Justice represented to me that &#703;Abdu-l-Wahh&#257;b, the son of
H&#803;ak&#299;m &#703;Al&#299;, claimed Rs. 80,000 from the Sayyids of
Lahore, and produced a bond with the seal of Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;
N&#363;ru-llah. He said that his father had placed that sum in deposit
with Sayyid Wal&#299;, the father of these men, who denied it.<a class=

caution,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5028src" href="#xd24e5028" name=
"xd24e5028src">88</a> would swear an oath on the Qoran, and would take
what was his due from them. I told them to do whatever was right by the
Divine Law. The next day Mu&#703;tamid K&#863;h&#257;n represented that
the Sayyids showed great humility and submissiveness. The matter was a
complicated<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5034src" href="#xd24e5034" name=
"xd24e5034src">89</a> one. The greater reflection shown in ascertaining
the truth in the matter the better. I accordingly ordered that
&#256;&#7779;af K. should take exceeding trouble and forethought in
ascertaining the truth of this quarrel, and point out such a way (of
unravelling it) that no doubt whatever should remain. With all this, if
it could not be cleared up, I would examine them in my own presence.
Immediately he heard these words, the H&#803;ak&#299;m&rsquo;s son lost
both his hands and his heart in the affair, and made a number of his
friends intercessors, and proposed a withdrawal. His representation was
that if the Sayyids would not<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5039src" href=
"#xd24e5039" name="xd24e5039src">90</a> refer the matter to
&#256;&#7779;af K. he would give a release, and that hereafter he would
have no right against nor claim from them. Whenever &#256;&#7779;af K.
sent to fetch him, as he was a low deceiver, he passed his time in
making excuses, and did not appear until he handed over the deed of
release to one of his friends, and the true state of affairs became
evident to &#256;&#7779;af K. They brought him by force into the place
of examination, and, having no choice, he confessed that the deed had
been prepared by one of his servants, who himself witnessed it, and had
misled him. He gave a writing to this effect. When &#256;&#7779;af K.
informed me of the real state of matters, I took away his mansab and
jagir, and cast him out of my presence, and gave the Sayyids leave to
return to Lahore in all honour and respect. <span class=

<p class="par">In Kashmir the most juicy(?) fruit is the
<i>as&#863;hkan</i>(?) (<i>askam&#299;</i> in the MSS.). It is subacid
(<i>mai-k&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h</i>), smaller than the <i>&#257;l&#363;
b&#257;l&#363;</i> (sour cherry), much better flavoured, and more
delicate. When drinking wine, one cannot eat more than three or four
<i>&#257;l&#363; b&#257;l&#363;</i>, but of these one can take as many
as a hundred in twenty-four hours, especially of the
<i>paiwand&#299;</i>(?) sort. I ordered that the <i>as&#863;hkan</i>
should hereafter be called the <i>k&#863;h&#363;s&#863;hkan</i>. It
grows in the hills of Badakhshan and in Khurasan; the people there call
it <i>jamdam&#299;</i>. The largest of them weigh &frac12;
<i>mis&#804;q&#257;l</i>. The <i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i>
(cherry), on the 4th Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, appeared of the size of a
grain of pulse; on the 27th it reddened, and on the 15th
K&#863;h&#363;rd&#257;d it was ripe, and new fruit (<i>nau-bar</i>) had
formed(?). The <i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> (cherry), to my
taste, is better than most fruits. Four trees had borne fruit in the
N&#363;r-afz&#257; garden. I called one of these
<i>S&#863;h&#299;r&#299;n-b&#257;r</i>, the second
<i>K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h-guw&#257;r</i>, the third, which bore the
most fruit, <i>Pur-b&#257;r</i>, and the fourth, which had less,
<i>Kam-b&#257;r</i>. One tree in K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s garden had also
borne fruit, and I called it <i>S&#863;h&#257;hw&#257;r</i>. There was
a young plant in the little garden of
<i>&#703;Is&#863;hrat-afz&#257;</i> (joy enhancing), and this I called
<i>Nau-b&#257;r</i> (new fruit). Every day I plucked with my own hand
sufficient to give a flavour to my cups. Although they sent them by
runners from Kabul as well, yet to pick them oneself from one&rsquo;s
home garden gave additional sweetness. The
<i>s&#863;h&#257;h-&#257;l&#363;</i> of Kashmir is not inferior to that
of Kabul; it is even better grown. The largest of them weighed one
<i>t&#257;nk</i>, five <i>surk&#863;hs</i>.</p>

astrologer, two months before this, had informed some of my servants
that one of the chief sitters in the harem of chastity would hasten to
the hidden abode of non-existence. He had discovered this from the
horoscope of my destiny, and it fell out accordingly.</p>
<p class="par">One of the events (that now took place) was the
martyrdom of Sayyid &#703;Izzat<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5135src"
href="#xd24e5135" name="xd24e5135src">92</a> K. and of Jal&#257;l K.
Gakhar in the army of Bangash. The particulars of this are that when
the season for the collection of revenue arrived, Mah&#257;bat K.
appointed a force to go into the hill-country to eat up the crops of
the Afghans, and not omit one tittle of raiding and plundering, and
killing and binding. When the servants of the Court arrived at the foot
of the Pass the ill-fated Afghans attacked them from all sides, and
took the head of the Pass, and fortified it. Jal&#257;l K., who was an
experienced man, and an old man that had undergone labours, thought it
better to delay for a few days, so that the Afghans might expend the
few days&rsquo; provisions they had brought with them on their backs,
and necessarily disperse of their own accord; that then his men would
be able to cross with ease over the head of the difficult Pass. When he
once passed the head of the defile they would be unable to do any more,
and would be punished. &#703;Izzat K., who was a battle-lighting flame
and a foe-burning lightning, did not fall in with Jal&#257;l K.&rsquo;s
idea, and excited the steed of courage of some of the Sayyids of
B&#257;rha. The Afghans, swarming round on all sides, like ants and
locusts, attacked him, and caught him in their midst. Though the
battlefield was not fit for cavalry, yet wherever the forehead of his
wrath shone, he consumed many with the fire of his sword. In the midst
of the fighting they hamstringed his horse, but he fought on foot and
as long as he had breath, and at last fell bravely. At the time when
&#703;Izzat K. made his attack, Jal&#257;l K. Gakhar<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e5138src" href="#xd24e5138" name="xd24e5138src">93</a> and
Mas&#703;&#363;d, s. Ah&#803;mad Beg K., and B&#299;zan <span class=

B&#299;zhan), s. N&#257;d &#703;Al&#299; Maid&#257;n&#299;, and other
servants, lost restraint, and rushed on from all sides of the pass, and
the rebels seized the tops of the hills, and fought with stones and
arrows. The devoted young men, both of the servants of the Court and
the retainers of Mah&#257;bat K., performed the duties of valour, and
slaughtered many of the Afghans. In this contest Jal&#257;l K. and
Mas&#703;&#363;d, with many other brave men, sacrificed their lives.
Owing to the rashness of &#703;Izzat K. such a disaster as this befell
the Imperial army.</p>
<p class="par">When Mah&#257;bat K. heard this fearful news, he sent a
fresh body of men to assist, and strengthened the posts. Wherever they
found a trace of those ill-fortuned ones, they did not fail to slay or
bind them. When I heard this news, I summoned Akbar Qul&#299;, s.
Jal&#257;l K. who had been told off for duty in the conquest of the
fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a, to my presence, and gave him the mansab of
1,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and confirmed to him, according to
custom, his hereditary territory (the Gakhar country) in jagir,
presented him with a dress of honour and a horse, and sent him to the
support of the army of Bangash. As &#703;Izzat K. had left a son of
very tender years, keeping before my eyes, that discerned the truth,
his life-sacrifice, I gave him (the child) a mansab and a jagir, so
that those left behind should not be scattered abroad, and others might
have increased hope.</p>
<p class="par">On this day S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad of Sirhind,
who had for some time been placed in the prison of correction on
account of his pretentiousness (literally, adorning his shop and
selling himself) and immoderate language, was summoned to my presence,
and I released him, giving him a dress of honour and Rs. 1,000 for
expenses, and making him free to go or remain. He justly represented
that his punishment had really been a valuable lesson to him, and that
his desire was to wait on me.</p>

Arriving in two matches at the foot of the <i>kotal</i>, on Wednesday,
the 17th, I reached the top of the pass. For a distance of 2 koss very
elevated ground was crossed with difficulty. From the top of the
<i>kotal</i> to the <i>&#298;l&#257;q</i> (summer quarters) was another
koss of high and low land. Although here and there flowers of various
colours had bloomed, yet I did not see so many as they had represented
to me, and as I had expected. I heard that in this neighbourhood there
was a very beautiful valley, and on Thursday, the 18th, I went to see
it. Undoubtedly, whatever praise they might use in speaking of that
flowery land would be permissible. As far as the eye reached flowers of
all colours were blooming. There were picked fifty kinds of flowers in
my presence. Probably there were others that I did not see. At the end
of the day I turned my reins in order to return. That night an account
was given in my presence of the siege of Ahmadnagar.
K&#863;h&#257;n-Jah&#257;n told a strange tale, which I had also heard
before, and it is written on account of its strangeness. At the time
when my brother D&#257;niy&#257;l was besieging the fort of Ahmadnagar,
one day the garrison laid the gun <i>Malik-maid&#257;n</i><a class=

"xd24e5202src">99</a> (king of the plain) against the Prince&rsquo;s
camp, and fired it. The ball reached nearly to the Prince&rsquo;s tent;
from that place it bounded (ricocheted), and went to the lodging of
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; B&#257;yaz&#299;d, who was one of the
Prince&rsquo;s companions, and fell there. They had tied up the
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;&rsquo;s horse at a distance of 3 or 4 gaz. As the
ball touched the ground, the horse&rsquo;s tongue<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5205src" href="#xd24e5205" name="xd24e5205src">100</a> was torn
out by the root and fell on the ground. The ball was of stone, weighing
10 maunds as current in Hindustan, or 80 Khurasar maunds. The said gun
is so large that a man can sit comfortably in it.</p>

it at this time, and on Tuesday, the 7th Amurd&#257;d, rode in that
direction. How shall I write its praise? As far as the eye could reach
flowers of various hue were blooming, and in the midst of the flowers
and verdure beautiful streams of water were flowing: one might say it
was a page that the painter of destiny had drawn with the pencil of
creation. The buds of hearts break into flower from beholding it.

<p class="par">On Thursday, the 17th, Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. was
promoted to the mansab of 1,500 personal and 700 horse. On this day the
ambassador of &#703;Izzat<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5302src" href=

name Muh&#803;ammad Z&#257;hid, came to the Court, and presented a
petition, accompanied with some trifling presents, and recalled the
existence of hereditary relations (lit., shook the chain of hereditary
connection). I distinguished him with the eye of kindness, and on the
spur of the moment gave the ambassador 10,000 darbs (Rs. 5,000) as a
present, and ordered the officials of the buy&#363;t&#257;t (household)
to prepare and send (by him) such things as he might ask for.</p>
<p class="par">At this time a strange act of grace occurred to my

become very ill from the madness of wine, and from the overpowering of
this man-destroying intoxication things had come to such a pass that it
threatened his precious life. Suddenly he reformed, and God directed
him, and he made a vow that thereafter he would not defile the fringe
of his lip with wine. Although I warned him that it was not good to
give it up all at once, and that he should leave it off gradually, he
would not consent, but gave it up manfully.</p>

themselves greatly in looking out for them. Of these,
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K. Naqs&#863;hband&#299; sent a servant of
the name of &#703;Abdu-llah with a letter to K&#863;hw&#257;ja

leading holy men of Transoxiana, containing a request for these things.
By chance, K&#863;hw&#257;ja H&#803;asan had a perfect tooth,
exceedingly delicate, and immediately sent it with the aforesaid
(servant) to the Court, which it reached this day. I was greatly
pleased, and ordered them to send the value of Rs. 30,000 in choice
goods to the K&#863;hw&#257;jas, a service for which M&#299;r Baraka
Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299; was fixed upon. On Thursday, the 12th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n obtained leave to take
up the faujd&#257;rship of Mew&#257;t, and his mansab, original and
increased, was fixed at 2,000 with 1,500 horse. I gave him a special
horse, with a dress of honour and a sword.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was made clear from a report of
Sundar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5334src" href="#xd24e5334" name=
"xd24e5334src">109</a> that Jauhar Mal, the rebel, had delivered his
soul to the lords of hell (had died). It was also reported that a force
sent against one of the Zamindars had abandoned the path of caution,
and without fortifying the way of entrance and exit, or taking
possession of the hill-tops, had entered into the fastnesses of the
hills, and had fought without any good result. As the day drew towards
its close, they had turned their reins with their object
unaccomplished, and in turning back, had made every haste. Many people
had been killed, especially those who would not put up with the
disgrace of flight. They purchased martyrdom with their lives. Out of
them S&#863;h&#257;h-b&#257;z K. Dal&#363;m&#257;n&#299;<a class=

servants and tribesmen. In truth he was a good servant, and had
intelligence combined with modesty. Another report was that Jam&#257;l
Afg&#863;h&#257;n, Rustam, his brother, Sayyid Na&#7779;&#299;b
B&#257;rha, and some others had come in wounded. It was also reported
that the siege (of K&#257;ng&#7771;a) had become a close one, and the
affair was going hard with the besieged. They had sent (literally
thrown out) men as mediators, and had asked for quarter. It was hoped
that by the blessing of increasing fortune the fort would be
subdued.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 18th of the same month
(S&#863;hahr&#299;war), Dil&#257;war K. K&#257;kar died a natural
death. Beyond all the other Amirs of high rank, he combined valour with
leadership and knowledge of affairs, and from the time when I was a
prince carried away from all the ball of superiority in my service. He
acted constantly with the perfection of sincerity and the jewel of
doing right, and had thus arrived at the dignity of Amirship. In the
end of his life God Almighty bestowed grace upon him, and the conquest
of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, which was an exemplary service, was
accomplished by his courage. It is hoped he may be one of the pardoned.
His sons and the others that he left behind him I exalted with all
kinds of favours and patronage, and enrolled those of his people who
were fit for mansabs amongst the servants of the Court. I ordered the
rest, to remain as usual with his sons, so that his company might not
be split up.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Q&#363;r Yas&#257;wul came with a diamond
that Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang had obtained from the Bengal
mine, and waited on me. Waz&#299;r K., d&#299;w&#257;n of Bengal, who
was an old servant of the Court, died a natural death.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Thursday, the 19th, the Kashmiris had
lined with lamps both sides of the Bihat. It is an ancient custom that
every year on this day everyone, whether rich or poor, whoever has a
house on the bank of the river, should light lamps as on the
S&#863;hab-i-bar&#257;t. I asked the brahmans the reason of this, and
they said that on this day the fountain-head of the Jhelam was
disclosed, and the custom had come down from old days that on this date
must take place the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"
name="pb168">168</a>]</span>feast of <i>Veth tarw&#257;h</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5354src" href="#xd24e5354" name=
"xd24e5354src">111</a> Veth means the Jhelam, and they call thirteen
<i>tarw&#257;h</i>; as this day is the 13th of S&#863;haww&#257;l, they
light lamps. In this way they call it the <i>Veth tarw&#257;h</i>.
Undoubtedly the lamp-lighting was good. I sate in a boat and went round
to see it. On this day the feast of my solar weighing took place, and
according to the usual custom, I weighed myself against gold and other
things, which I distributed among deserving people. The 51st year of
the age of this suppliant at the throne of Allah came to an end; the
52nd year lit up the face of expectation. It is hoped that the period
of my life will be spent in pleasing God. The entertainment of
Thursday, the 26th, was held in the lodging of &#256;&#7779;af K.
(N&#363;r-Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s brother), and that pillar of the Sultanate
fulfilled the duties of homage, and of offerings, and thereby acquired
eternal bliss.</p>

<p class="par">On this day unpleasant news came from
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r. The details of this are that when Dil&#257;war K.
conquered it and returned to Court, he left Na&#7779;ru-llah
&#703;Arab, with some of the mansabdars to guard it. Na&#7779;ru-llah
made two mistakes. One was that he treated the Zamindars and the people
of the place harshly, and did not observe a conciliatory demeanour
towards them. The second was that the forces sent as auxiliaries to
him, in expectation of increase of mansab, asked him for leave to go to
Court and transact their affairs. He yielded to their
representations,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5657src" href="#xd24e5657"
name="xd24e5657src">119</a> and gave them leave one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>after the other. When only a small force was
left with him, the Zamindars, whose hearts had been wounded by him, and
were on the look out for a disturbance, found their opportunity and
made an attack from all quarters. Having burnt the bridge by which the
army had crossed, and by which assistance could come, they lighted the
fire of disturbance and sedition. Na&#7779;ru-llah shut himself up, and
for two or three days defended himself with the greatest difficulty
(literally, with a thousand life-extractions). As he had no provisions,
and they had closed the road, he determined to accept martyrdom, and
manfully, with some of those who were with him, performed the dues of
bravery and valour until most of his men were killed, and some became
captives in the hands of destiny.</p>
<p class="par">When this news reached my ear, I appointed Jal&#257;l,
s. Dil&#257;war K., on whose forehead the traces of bravery and
ambition were manifest, and who had done good service in the conquest
of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, with the mansab of 1,000 personal and 600
horse, giving him the attendants of his father who were enrolled among
the servants of the Court, and an army of the soldiers of Kashmir, with
many of the Zamindars and men on foot with muskets, to assist him in
overcoming that mob, doomed to a vile end. An order was also given that
R&#257;ja Sangr&#257;m, the Zamindar of Jammu, with his own men, should
come in by the hill-road from Jammu. It is hoped that the rebels will
quickly obtain the recompense for their deeds.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 28th, I marched 4&frac12; koss. Passing
one koss beyond K&#257;k&#257;p&#363;r, I came to the bank of the

cash and goods, which were given to his sons.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 30th, I first visited the fountain of
Inch. This village had been given by my father to R&#257;m D&#257;s
Kachhw&#257;ha,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5715src" href="#xd24e5715"
name="xd24e5715src">126</a> and he had erected buildings and basins at
the spring. Undoubtedly, it is an exceedingly sweet and delightful
place. Its water is perfectly clear and pure, and many fish swim in
it.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4><span class="sc">Verse.</span></h4>
<p class="line">So clear the water that the grains of sand at
bottom</p>
<p class="line">Could be counted at midnight by a blind man.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">As I gave<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5728src"
href="#xd24e5728" name="xd24e5728src">127</a> the village to my son
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, he prepared an entertainment there, and
presented offerings. I chose a trifle in order to please him. Half a
koss from this spring, there is a fountain that they call Machh&#299;
Bhawan,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5731src" href="#xd24e5731" name=
"xd24e5731src">128</a> above which R&#257;y Bih&#257;r&#299; Chand, one
of the servants of my father, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173"
href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>built an idol-temple. The
beauty of this spring is more than one can describe, and large trees of
ancient years, planes, white and black poplars, have grown up round it.
I passed the night at this place, and on Tuesday, the 31st, pitched at
the fountain of Achval.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5739src" href=
"#xd24e5739" name="xd24e5739src">129</a> The water of this spring is
more plentiful than that of the other, and it has a fine waterfall.
Around it lofty plane-trees and graceful white poplars, bringing their
heads together, have made enchanting places to sit in. As far as one
could see, in a beautiful garden, <i>Ja&#703;far&#299;</i> flowers had
bloomed, so that one might say it was a piece of Paradise. On
Wednesday, the 1st of Mihr, marching from Achval, I pitched camp near
the fountain of V&#299;rn&#257;g.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5746src"
href="#xd24e5746" name="xd24e5746src">130</a> On Thursday, the 2nd, the
feast of cups was prepared at the spring. I gave my private attendants
permission to sit down. Filling brimming cups, I gave them Kabul
peaches as a relish, and in the evening they returned drunk
(<i>mast&#257;n</i>, exhilarated?) to their abodes. This spring is the
source of the River Bihat, and is situated at the foot of a hill, the
soil of which, from the abundance of trees and the extent of green and
grass, is not seen. When I was a prince, I had given an order that they
should erect a building at this spring suitable to the place. It was
now completed. There was a reservoir of an octagonal shape, forty-two
yards in area and fourteen<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5752src" href=
"#xd24e5752" name="xd24e5752src">131</a> gaz in depth. Its water, from
the reflection of the grass and plants on the hill, had assumed a hue
of verdure. Many fish swam in it, round it halls with domes had been
erected, and there was a garden in front of them. From the edge of the
pond to the gate<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5755src" href="#xd24e5755"
name="xd24e5755src">132</a> of the garden there was a canal 1 gaz in
width and 180<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5758src" href="#xd24e5758"
name="xd24e5758src">133</a> gaz in length, and 2 gaz in depth. Round
the reservoir was a stone walk
(<i>k&#863;hiy&#257;b&#257;n-i-sang</i>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>The water of the
reservoir was so clear that, notwithstanding its 4 gaz of depth, if a
pea had fallen into it, it could have been seen. Of the trimness of the
canal and the verdure of the grass that grew below the fountain, what
can one write? Various<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5767src" href=
"#xd24e5767" name="xd24e5767src">134</a> sorts of plants and
sweet-smelling herbs grew there in profusion, and among them was seen a
stem (<i>b&#363;&#7789;&#257;</i>), which had exactly the appearance of
the variegated tail of a peacock. It waved about in the ripple, and
bore flowers here and there. In short, in the whole of Kashmir there is
no sight of such beauty and enchanting character. It appears to me that
what is upstream<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5773src" href="#xd24e5773"
name="xd24e5773src">135</a> in Kashmir bears no comparison with
(<i>i.e.</i>, is far superior to) what is downstream. One should stay
some days in these regions, and go round them so as to enjoy oneself
thoroughly. As the hour for marching was near, and snow was beginning
to fall at the head of the passes, I had not the leisure to linger
there, and was obliged to turn my rein towards the city. I gave an
order that plane-trees should be planted on both sides, on the banks of
the canal above mentioned. On Saturday, the 4th, I encamped at the
spring of Loka Bhawan.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5779src" href=
"#xd24e5779" name="xd24e5779src">136</a> This spring is also a pleasant
spot. Although at present it is not equal to the others, if it were to
be repaired it would be very good. I ordered them to construct a
building worthy of the place, and to repair the reservoir in front of
it. On the road I passed by a spring which they call Andha
N&#257;g<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5783src" href="#xd24e5783" name=
"xd24e5783src">137</a> (blind fountain. <i>See</i>
Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma, 166). It is well known that the fish in this
fountain are blind. I delayed a while near this spring, and threw in a
net and caught twelve of the fish. Of these, three were blind and nine
had eyes. Evidently the water of this spring has the effect of making
them blind. Certainly this is not devoid of strangeness. On Sunday, the
5th, I again passed by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>the springs of Machh&#299; Bhawan
and Inch, and went to the city.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 8th, news arrived of the death of
H&#257;s&#863;him, s. Q&#257;sim K. On Thursday, the 9th, Ir&#257;dat
K. was promoted to the governorship of Kashmir. M&#299;r Jumla in his
place was chosen for the duty of <i>K&#863;h&#257;ns&#257;m&#257;n</i>,
and Mu&#703;tamid<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5799src" href="#xd24e5799"
name="xd24e5799src">138</a> K. to that of
<i>&#703;Arz&#803;-muqarrir</i>. The mansab of 2,000 personal and 500
horse was ordered for M&#299;r Jumla. On the night of Saturday, the
11th, I entered the city. &#256;&#7779;af K. was appointed to the duty
of Diwan of Gujarat. Sangr&#257;m, Raja of Jammu, was promoted to the
mansab of 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse.</p>
<p class="par">On this day I saw an unusual kind of fishing on the part
of the fishermen of Kashmir. In a place where the water was up to a
man&rsquo;s chest, they propelled two boats that were side by side, and
so that at one end they were in contact, and at the other end they were
14 or 15 yards apart. Two boatmen held long poles in their hands, and
sate on the outside edge of each boat (?) so as to regulate the space
between each boat, and that they should proceed equally. Then ten or
twelve boatmen got down into the water, and laying hold of the ends of
the two boats that were joined<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5807src"
href="#xd24e5807" name="xd24e5807src">139</a> together with their
hands, trampled the bottom with their feet, and moved on. The fish
which were between the boats wanted to get out of the narrow space, and
came against the feet of the boatmen. Immediately one of the boatmen
dived, and another one pressed upon his back, and with his two hands
kept him from coming to the surface. The latter caught a fish and
produced it. Some who are skilful in the art catch two fish with their
hands, and bring them to the surface. Among them was an old boatman,
who generally at each dive brought up two fish. This kind of fishing
occurs at Panj Br&#257;ra,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5813src" href=
"#xd24e5813" name="xd24e5813src">140</a> and is peculiar to the Jhelam.
It is not used in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176"
name="pb176">176</a>]</span>ponds or in other streams. It also only
takes place in the spring when the water is not cold or impetuous
(<i>gazanda</i>, &ldquo;biting&rdquo;?).</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 13th, the feast of the Dasahr&#257; took
place. According to the annual custom, they decorated the horses in the
special stables, and those that had been entrusted to Amirs, and
brought them out. At this time I experienced in myself a shortness of
breath and difficulty in breathing. I hope that in the end, please God,
it may all go well.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, the 15th, I went to make an autumn tour in
the direction of &#7778;af&#257;p&#363;r and the valley of L&#257;r,
situated downstream of the Kashmir River. In &#7778;af&#257;p&#363;r
there is a fine tank, and on the north side of it a hill full of trees.
It being the beginning of autumn, it had a wonderful appearance, with
trees of all colours, such as the planes, the apricot, and others,
reflected in the middle of the tank, and very beautiful. Undoubtedly
the beauties of autumn are not less than those of spring.</p>

<p class="par first">As the time was short and the hour of marching
near, I took a short circuit and returned. These few days I passed
pleasantly in catching<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5835src" href=
"#xd24e5835" name="xd24e5835src">141</a> ducks. One day, in the midst
of the sport, a boatman caught and brought me a young <i>qarqara</i>
(the demoiselle crane, <i>Ardea virgo</i>). It was very thin and
miserable. It did not live longer than one night. The <i>qarqara</i>
does not live in Kashmir. This had become ill and thin at the time of
coming from, or going to, Hindustan, and fallen there.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday news came of the death of M&#299;rz&#257;
Rah&#803;m&#257;nd&#257;d, s. the
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n. He died a natural death at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r. It appears that he had been suffering from
fever for some days. When he was recovering, the Deccanis one day
appeared with an army. His elder brother, D&#257;r&#257;b K., mounted
with the intention of fighting. When the news <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>reached Rah&#803;m&#257;n-d&#257;d, with great
bravery, notwithstanding his weakness and failing health, he went to
his brother. After he had beaten the enemy, he returned and in taking
off his <i>jubba</i> (quilted waistcoat) was not sufficiently careful.
The wind immediately caught him, and he was seized with convulsions,
and his tongue became powerless to speak. He remained two or three days
in this state and died. He was a good and brave youth, was fond of
sword-play, and was very zealous. In every place it was his idea to
display his skill with the sword. Although fire burns equally what is
green and what is dry, yet it appeared very grievous to me, and what
must it have been to his broken-hearted old father? Hardly had the
wound from the calamity of S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K. healed, when
he received this fresh wound. I trust that God Almighty may give him
patience and resignation.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 16th, K&#863;hanjar K. was promoted to
the mansab of 3,000 personal and horse, Q&#257;sim K. to that of 2,000
personal and 1,000 horse, and Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, brother of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, who held the post of
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; to the army of K&#257;ng&#7771;a, that of 800
personal and horse. On the night<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5860src"
href="#xd24e5860" name="xd24e5860src">142</a> of Monday, the 27th of
the Divine month of Mihr, after one watch and seven gharis had passed,
the royal standards were raised auspiciously and happily to return
towards Hindustan. As the saffron had blossomed, a march was made from
the neighbourhood of the city to the village of
P&#257;mp&#363;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5863src" href="#xd24e5863"
name="xd24e5863src">143</a> In the whole country of Kashmir there is
saffron only in this place. On Thursday, the 30th, the feast of cups
was held in a saffron field. Groves on groves, and plains on plains
were in bloom. The breeze in that place scented one&rsquo;s brain. The
stem is attached (close?) to the ground. The flower has four petals,
and its colour is that of a violet. It is of the size of a
<i>champa</i> flower, and from the middle of it three stigmas of
saffron grow. They plant the bulbs, and in a good year obtain 400
maunds of the current <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>weight or 3,002<a class="noteref"

Khurasan maunds. The custom is for half to go to the government, and
half to the cultivators. A seer is bought and sold for Rs. 10.
Occasionally its market price is more or less, and it is an established
custom that they bring the saffron flowers plucked, and according to
the plan they have adopted from of old, they take half its weight in
salt as wages. There is no salt in Kashmir, and they bring it from
Hindustan. Again, among the excellencies of Kashmir are the plumes of
feathers (<i>kalg&#299;</i>) and the hawks
(<i>j&#257;nwar-i-s&#863;hik&#257;r&#299;</i>). As much as 10,700
feathers are yearly obtained. Hawks and falcons are taken in nets to
the number of 260. It has also nest sparrow-hawks
(<i>b&#257;s&#863;ha</i>),<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5884src" href=
"#xd24e5884" name="xd24e5884src">145</a> and the nest sparrow-hawk is
not bad. On Friday, the 1st of the divine month of &#256;b&#257;n,
marching from P&#257;mp&#363;r, I pitched my camp at
K&#863;h&#257;np&#363;r. As it was reported to me that
Zamb&#299;l<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5889src" href="#xd24e5889" name=
"xd24e5889src">146</a> Beg, ambassador from my brother S&#863;h&#257;h
&#703;Abb&#257;s, had reached the neighbourhood of Lahore, a dress of
honour and Rs. 30,000 for expenses were sent to him by M&#299;r
H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n s. &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula
Inj&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5892src" href="#xd24e5892" name=

entertaining the ambassador should be sent to him to the extent of Rs.
5,000.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5896src" href="#xd24e5896" name=
"xd24e5896src">148</a> Before this I had directed that from Kashmir to
the end of the hilly country buildings should be erected at each stage
for the accommodation of myself and the ladies, for in the cold weather
one should not be in tents. Although the buildings at this stage had
been completed, as they were still damp and there was a smell of lime,
we put up in tents. On Saturday, the 2nd, I halted at Kalamp&#363;r. As
it had repeatedly been represented to me that in the neighbourhood of
H&#299;r&#257;p&#363;r there was a waterfall<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5899src" href="#xd24e5899" name="xd24e5899src">149</a> very high
and wonderful, as it was 3 or 4 koss off on the left <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>of
the road, I hastened there to see it. What can be written in its
praise? The water pours down in three or four gradations(?). I had
never seen such a beautiful waterfall. Without hesitation, it is a
sight to be seen, very strange and wonderful. I passed the time there
in enjoyment till the third watch of the day, and filled my eye and
heart with the sight; but in the cloudy and rainy season it is not
devoid of wildness. After the third watch had passed, in the evening I
rode back to H&#299;r&#257;p&#363;r,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5904src" href="#xd24e5904" name="xd24e5904src">150</a> and passed
the night at that stage. On Monday, the 4th, crossing over the
<i>kotal</i> of B&#257;r&#299; Br&#257;r&#299;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5910src" href="#xd24e5910" name="xd24e5910src">151</a> I chose
P&#299;rpanjal, at the head of the <i>kotal</i>, for a halting-place.
Of the roughnesses of the pass and the difficulties of this road what
shall I write? It is difficult for thought even to cross it. In these
last few days snow had repeatedly fallen, the hills had become white,
and in the middle of the path in some places ice had formed, so that
the hoof of a horse had no hold, and a rider could only pass with
difficulty. God Almighty bestowed upon us His mercy, for it did not
snow on this day. The advantage was for those who went on in front.
Those who followed came in for snow. On Tuesday, the 5th, going by the
pass of P&#299;rpanjal the camp was pitched at Pos&#863;h&#257;na.
Although on this side there is a descent, yet as it is high, most of
the people passed it on foot. On Wednesday, the 6th, we pitched at
Bahramgalla. Near this village there is a waterfall and a very fine
spring. According to orders, they had made a terrace for me to sit
upon; indeed, this is a sight to be seen. I ordered that they should
engrave on a stone tablet the date of the crossing, and place it on the
top of the terrace (<i>&#7779;uffa</i>). B&#299;-badal K.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5920src" href="#xd24e5920" name=
"xd24e5920src">152</a> composed some couplets, and this mark of my
fortune remains on the path of poetry as a memorial on the tablet of
Time(?). There are two Zamindars on this road in whose charge are the
arrangements <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>for the traffic on it, and they are in reality
the keys of the country of Kashmir. They call one Mahd&#299; N&#257;yak
and the other H&#803;usain N&#257;yak. The charge of the road from
H&#299;r&#257;p&#363;r to Bahramgalla is in their hands. Bahr&#257;m
N&#257;yak, the father of Mahd&#299; N&#257;yak, during the Kashmiri
government, was an important person. When the authority passed to the
imperial servants, M&#299;rz&#257; Y&#363;suf K., during his
government, made Bahr&#257;m N&#257;yak a traveller to the country of
non-existence. It is now equally in the possession and charge of the
two.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5931src" href="#xd24e5931" name=

really bear great enmity towards each other. On this day
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ibn Yam&#299;n, who was one of the old trusted
servants, went to the neighbourhood of God&rsquo;s mercy
(died).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5940src" href="#xd24e5940" name=

and drinking water<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5947src" href=
"#xd24e5947" name="xd24e5947src">155</a> were in his charge. On the
night when we were encamped above the <i>kotal</i> of P&#299;rpanjal,
the tents and furniture had not arrived. He was rather infirm and the
cold affected him, and he became cramped so that he could not speak. He
remained alive for two days in this state and then died. I gave over
the private opium to K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K., and the
<i>&#257;b-d&#257;r-k&#863;h&#257;na</i> (the water department) to
M&#363;saw&#299; K. On Thursday, the 7th, the village of
Th&#257;na<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5956src" href="#xd24e5956" name=
"xd24e5956src">156</a> became the encamping place. Many monkeys
(<i>maim&#363;n</i>) were seen in Bahramgalla, and from that stage a
great difference was apparent in the climate, the language, the
clothing, the animals, and whatever properly belongs to a warm country.
The people here speak both Persian and Hindi. Evidently Hindi is their
real language, and they have acquired Kashmiri on account of the
proximity of Kashmir. Briefly, one enters India at this place. The
women do not wear woollen clothing, and like Indian women, they wear
nose-rings.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 8th, R&#257;jaur was the camping-ground.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>people of this country were in old times Hindus,
and the landholders are called Rajas. Sult&#804;&#257;n F&#299;r&#363;z
made them Muhammadans, but they are still called Rajas. They still have
the marks of the times of ignorance. One of these is that just as some
Hindu women burn themselves along with their husbands (bodies), so
these women (the R&#257;jaur women) are put into the grave along with
their (dead) husbands. I heard that recently they put alive into the
grave a girl of ten or twelve along with her (dead) husband, who was of
the same age. Also, when a daughter is born to a man without means,
they put her to death by strangulation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5966src" href="#xd24e5966" name="xd24e5966src">157</a> They ally
themselves with Hindus, and both give and take girls. Taking them is
good, but giving them, God forbid! I gave an order that hereafter they
should not do such things, and whoever was guilty of them, should be
capitally punished. There is a river at R&#257;jaur. Its water during
the rainy season becomes much poisoned. Many of the people there get a
swelling (<i>b&#363;g&#863;hma</i>) under the throat, and are yellow
and weak. The rice of R&#257;jaur is much<a class="noteref" id=

than the rice of Kashmir. There are self-grown and sweet-scented
violets in this skirt of the hills.</p>
<p class="par">On Sunday, the 10th, I encamped at Naus&#863;hahra. At
this place, by order of my father, they had built a stone fort, and
there is constantly here, by way of a station (<i>th&#257;na</i>), a
body of men from the governor of Kashmir. On Monday the camp was at
Chauk&#299; Hatt&#299;. A <i>chela</i> named Mur&#257;d had exerted
himself to complete the buildings at this place, and had done it well.
In the middle of the royal abode there was a fine terrace, superior to
those of other stages. I increased his mansab. On Tuesday, the 12th, I
halted at Bh&#299;mbar. Passing this day out of <i>kotals</i> and
hills, we entered the broad plains of Hindustan. The hunters had
previously been dispatched to form <i>qamurg&#863;has</i>, so as to
prepare <i>jirgas</i> (hunting rings) in Bh&#299;mbar and
Girjh&#257;k<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5996src" href="#xd24e5996"
name="xd24e5996src">159</a> and Makhiy&#257;la. On Wednesday
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=

rejoiced in a hunt. Hill <i>q&#363;chq&#257;r</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6009src" href="#xd24e6009" name="xd24e6009src">160</a> etc.,
to the number of 56 head were taken. On this day R&#257;ja S&#257;rang
Deo, who was one of the intimate attendants, was promoted to the mansab
of 800 personal and 400 horse. On Saturday, the 16th, I went towards
Girjh&#257;k, and in five marches encamped on the bank of the Bihat. On
Thursday, the 21st, I hunted in the hunting-ring of Girjh&#257;k. Less
game than usual was taken, and I was not satisfied. On Monday, the
25th, I hunted with much enjoyment in the hunting-ring of
Makhiy&#257;la,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6012src" href="#xd24e6012"
name="xd24e6012src">161</a> thence in ten stages I encamped at the
stage of the hunting-place of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#257;b&#257;d. When I
was prince, this was my hunting-place. Afterwards, I founded a village
with my own name, and erecting a small building, placed it in charge of
Sikandar Mu&#703;&#299;n, who was one of my best huntsmen. After I came
to the throne I made a pargana of it, and bestowed it as a jagir on
him. I gave an order that they should construct there a building as a
royal residence, with a tank and a minaret<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6018src" href="#xd24e6018" name="xd24e6018src">162</a>
(man&#257;ra). After his death this pargana was given in jagir to
Ir&#257;dat K., and the charge of the buildings was given to him. It
has now been handsomely completed. Undoubtedly the tank was very
broad,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6022src" href="#xd24e6022" name=
"xd24e6022src">163</a> and in the middle there is a delightful
building. Altogether the buildings here cost Rs. 1,50,000. Really it is
a kingly hunting-place. On Thursday and Friday, having halted, I
enjoyed myself with various kinds of sport. Q&#257;sim K., who was
honoured with the charge of Lahore, had the good fortune to pay his
respects to me, and presented 50 muhars.</p>
<p class="par">In one march after this stage I encamped at the garden
of M&#363;min &#703;Is&#863;hq-b&#257;z,<a class="noteref" id=

lofty plane-trees and handsome cypresses. It is certainly a rare
garden. On Monday, the 9th of the Divine month of &#256;z&#817;ar,
corresponding with the 5th Muh&#803;arram of <span class=

an elephant of the name of Indra, I went towards the city, scattering
coin as I proceeded. After three watches and two gharis of day had
passed, at the selected auspicious hour, having entered the royal
residence, I alighted happily and auspiciously at the building recently
brought to completion and finished handsomely by the exertions of
Ma&#703;m&#363;r K. Without exaggeration, charming residences and
soul-exciting sitting places had been erected in great beauty and
delicacy, adorned and embellished with paintings by rare artists.
Pleasant green gardens with all kinds of flowers and sweet-scented
herbs deceived the sight.</p>

<p class="par">On this day the joy-enhancing news of the conquest of
the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a rejoiced our mind. In thankfulness for
this great boon and important victory, which was one of the renewed
favours of the Bestower of Gifts, I bowed the head of humility at the
throne of the merciful Creator, and beat with loud sounds the drum of
gladness and pleasure. K&#257;ng&#7771;a is an ancient fort to the
North of Lahore, situated in the midst of the hill country, famous for
its strength and the difficulty of conquering it. Who was the founder
of this fort God only knows. The belief of the Zamindars of the
province of the Panjab is that, during this period the said fort has
never passed to any other tribe, and no stranger has stretched out to
it the hand of dominion. Wisdom is from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>Allah! But certainly
from the time when the voice of Islam and the sound of the established
religion of Muh&#803;ammad reached Hindustan, not one of the Sultans of
lofty dignity has obtained the victory over it. Sult&#804;&#257;n
F&#299;r&#363;z-s&#863;h&#257;h, with all his power and might, himself
went to conquer it, and besieged it for a long time. As he knew that
the strength of the fort was such that as long as the means for holding
it and provisions were with the besieged, victory over them was
unattainable, <i>nolens volens</i> he was contented with the coming of
the Raja to pay his respects to him, and withheld his hand. They say
that the Raja prepared an offering and an entertainment, and at his
request took the Sultan inside the fort. The Sultan, after going round
and inspecting it, said to the Raja that to bring a king like him
inside the fort was not according to the dictates of caution. What
could he do if the body of men who were in attendance were to attack
him and take possession of the fort? The Raja made a sign to his men,
and instantaneously an army of valiant men armed and accoutred, came
out from a concealed place and saluted the Sultan. The Sultan became
suspicious and anxious about an attack from these men, and suspected
some stratagem. The Raja came forward and kissed the ground of service,
and said: &ldquo;I have no thought but that of service and obedience,
but as has been spoken by the auspicious tongue, I observe far-sighted
caution, for all times are not the same.&rdquo; The Sultan applauded
him. The Raja, having accompanied him for some stages, obtained leave
to return. After this, whoever sat on the throne of Delhi sent an army
to subdue K&#257;ng&#7771;a, but the thing went no further. My revered
father also sent a large army once under the leadership of H&#803;usain
Qul&#299; K., who, after approved service, was honoured with the title
of K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. Whilst the siege was in progress, the
outbreak of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain M&#299;rz&#257; took place.
That ingrate fled from Gujarat, and raised the flag of rebellion and
calamity towards the Panjab. K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n was compelled
to raise the siege, and to turn to extinguish the flame of his
sedition. Thus the acquisition of the fort fell into the knot of delay.
The thought was continually lurking in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>royal mind: &ldquo;The longed-for Fair one does
not show her face from the secret place of Destiny.&rdquo; When by the
Grace of the Glorious God the throne of the State was adorned by the
existence of this suppliant, this was one of the holy wars which I
considered incumbent on me. In the first instance I dispatched
Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., who was governor of the Panjab, with a force of
brave men skilled in war, to conquer the fort. This important matter
had not been completed when Murtaz&#803;&#257; K. attained to the mercy
of God (died). After this Jauhar Mal,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6064src" href="#xd24e6064" name="xd24e6064src">168</a> s.
R&#257;ja B&#257;so, undertook this duty. I sent him, giving him the
command of the army. That wicked one, taking to evil revolt and
ingratitude, committed sin, and dispersion found its way into that
army, and the acquisition of the fort fell into the knot of delay. No
long time elapsed before that ingrate received the recompense of his
deeds and went to hell, as has been described in its own
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6070src" href="#xd24e6070" name=
"xd24e6070src">169</a> In fine, at this time K&#863;hurram undertook
that duty, and sent his own servant Sundar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6074src" href="#xd24e6074" name="xd24e6074src">170</a> with all
haste, and many of the royal servants obtained leave to go to his
support. On the 16th S&#863;haww&#257;l, <span class="sc">A.H.</span>
1029, (5 September, 1620), the armies, having invested the fort,
erected batteries. Looking to the ways of entrance into and exit from
the fort with the eye of caution, they closed the road for the entrance
of provisions. By degrees the besieged became straitened, and when
there remained in the fort no grain that they could eat, for four
months more they boiled dry grasses<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6083src"
href="#xd24e6083" name="xd24e6083src">171</a> with salt and ate it.
When destruction was imminent, and no hope of escape was left, they
asked for quarter and surrendered the fort.</p>

distant to the short-sighted, God Almighty of His own grace and mercy
granted to this suppliant. The troops, who had displayed praiseworthy
activity in this service, were exalted according to their exertions and
fitness by increase of mansab and dignities.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 11th, I went, at the request of
K&#863;hurram, to his newly-built house. I took those of his offerings
that pleased me. Three elephants were placed in the private stud. On
the same day I appointed &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K.
Naqs&#863;hband&#299; to the faujd&#257;rship of the district of
K&#257;ng&#7771;a, and his mansab was fixed at 2,000 personal and 1,500
horse. I gave a private elephant to I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. Alf K.
Qiy&#257;m-k&#863;h&#257;n&#299; K. obtained leave to take charge of
the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a, and his mansab, original and increased,
was fixed at 1,500 personal and 1,000 horse. S&#863;haik&#863;h
Faiz&#803;u-llah, son-in-law of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K., was appointed in
company with him to stay at the top of the fort
(<i>b&#257;l&#257;-i-qil&#703;a</i>).</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Saturday, the 13th of the same month, a
lunar eclipse took place. Having performed the dues of humility at the
throne of the highest and most powerful God, cash and goods were
distributed by way of charity among the faq&#299;rs and poor, and
deserving people. On this day Zamb&#299;l Beg, ambassador of the ruler
of Persia, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. After performing
salutation, he laid before me the gracious letter of that brother of
high degree, containing expressions of sincerity and perfect
friendship. He presented 12 <i>&#703;Abb&#257;s&#299;</i><a class=

trappings, three <i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i> (white) falcons, five
mules, five camels, nine bows, and nine scimitars. The Shah had given
him leave, in company with K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, but for
certain necessary matters he could not come with him. On this day he
arrived at Court. I presented him with a superb dress of honour, with a
plume and a jewelled turban fringe, and a jewelled dagger.
Wi&#7779;&#257;l Beg and H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Ni&#703;mat, who had come
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=

Am&#257;nu-llah, s. Mah&#257;bat K., was promoted to the mansab,
original and increased, of 2,000 and 1,500 horse. At the request of
Mah&#257;bat K., I added 300 horse to the mansab of Mub&#257;riz K.
Afg&#863;h&#257;n, and brought it up to 2,000 personal and 1,700 horse.
One hundred horse were also added to the mansab of Kabak<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6125src" href="#xd24e6125" name=
"xd24e6125src">174</a> (?). I sent winter dresses of honour to
&#703;Abdu-llah K. and Las&#863;hkar K. At the request of Q&#257;sim K.
I went to his garden in the neighbourhood of the city, and in the
course of the procession, scattered 10,000 <i>charans</i> (4-anna
pieces). Out of his offerings I selected one ruby and one diamond, and
some cloths.</p>
<p class="par">On the night of Sunday, the 21st, the advanced camp
proceeded auspiciously and happily towards Agra. Barq-and&#257;z K. was
appointed superintendent of artillery with the army of the Deccan.
S&#863;haik&#863;h Ish&#803;&#257;q (Isaac) was appointed to duty at

released from prison, and made him a present of Rs. 10,000. I gave also
a <i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i> falcon to K&#863;hurram. On Thursday,
the 26th, the usual entertainment took place. The presents from the
ruler of Persia, which had been sent by Zamb&#299;l Beg, were laid
before me. I gave an elephant to Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain, and
made a present of Rs. 1,000 to Mull&#257; Muh&#803;ammad

Most of the Amirs and the chief servants went to his house with gifts.
He prepared a grand entertainment with much ceremony. It is hoped that
it may be auspicious to him. As that Chief of the State had erected
lofty buildings, and highly decorated bowers in his house, he invited
me to an entertainment. I went there with the ladies. He had prepared a
great feast, and laid before me appropriate offerings of all kinds. In
order to please him, I took such as I approved of. On this day Rs.
50,000 were presented to Zamb&#299;l Beg, the ambassador. The mansab of
Zabar-dast K. was fixed at 1,000 personal and 500 horse, original and
increased. Maq&#7779;&#363;d, brother of Q&#257;sim K., was promoted to
the mansab of 500 personal and 300 horse, and M&#299;rz&#257;
Dakhan&#299;, s. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam, to that of 500 personal and
200 horse.</p>
<p class="par">At this auspicious time<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6173src" href="#xd24e6173" name="xd24e6173src">178</a> when the
standards of victory and conquest were in Kashmir, the province of
eternal spring, happily employed in sight-seeing and sport,
representations constantly came from the officials in the Southern
territories to the effect that when the victorious standards went to a
distance from the centre of the Khalifate, the rulers of the Deccan,
owing to their wickedness, broke their promises and raised their heads
by giving trouble and exciting sedition, and placing their feet beyond
their own boundary, took possession of many of the districts of
Ahmadnagar and Berar. It was constantly reported that the chief object
of these evil-fortuned ones was to plunder and ruin the cultivated
fields and the grazing-lands. When at the first time the world-opening
standards had proceeded to the conquest of the regions of the south and
the overthrow of that band, and K&#863;hurram, with the vanguard, had
gone to Burhanpur, they, by feline tricks suitable to such seditious
people, made him their intercessor and evacuated the royal dominions.
They also sent by way of tribute large sums in cash and goods, and
promised that they would not let loose from their hands the rope of
service, and would not place their feet beyond the boundary of respect,
as has been recorded in the preceding <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>pages. At the request
of K&#863;hurram, I had halted for a few days at the Fort of
S&#863;h&#257;d&#299;&#702;&#257;b&#257;d M&#257;nd&#363;, and at his
intercession, and on their humiliation and bewailing, they were
pardoned.</p>
<p class="par">As they had now broken their agreement through evil
disposition and quarrelsomeness, and had turned back from the way of
obedience and service, I sent off the hosts of good fortune again under
his leadership, that they might receive retribution for their evil
deeds, and be an example to all those of crooked fortune and turned
heads. But as the important business of K&#257;ng&#7771;a had been
entrusted to him, he had sent most of his experienced men there. For
some days, accordingly, he could not arrange the matter. At last,
report followed on report one after another, that the enemy had
gathered strength, and that nearly 60,000 vagabond horsemen had
collected together and taken possession of royal territory, and
wherever there were posts, had removed them, and joined together in the
town of Mahakar. For three months the imperialists had passed their
days in strife and fighting with their rascally enemies, and during
this time three pitched battles had taken place, and each time the
self-sacrificing servants (of the State) had proved superior to the
evil-fortuned rebels. As grain and provisions could not reach the camp
by any road, and the enemy was plundering on all sides of the army of
good fortune, a great scarcity of grain resulted, and the animals were
in bad plight. Having no choice, they came down from the
B&#257;l&#257;g&#863;h&#257;t, and took up their position at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r. The rebels, waxing valiant in their pursuit,
engaged in plundering in the neighbourhood of B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r.
Of the servants of the Court 6,000 or 7,000 horsemen, well mounted,
were selected, and they made an attack on the enemy&rsquo;s camp. They
(the enemy) numbered about 60,000 cavalry. Briefly, a great fight took
place, and their camp was plundered. Having killed and taken prisoners
many of them, they returned in safety and with plunder. When they
turned back those wretches again attacked them from all sides, and they
came on, fighting as far as the camp. On both sides about 1,000 were
killed. After this fight they (the imperialists) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>remained about four months at
B&#257;l&#257;p&#363;r. When the scarcity of grain became excessive,
many of the qulaqch&#299;s (servants) ran away and joined the enemy,
and constantly bands of them, taking to the road of disloyalty, were
enrolled among the rebels. On this account, not considering it
advisable to delay any longer, they (the imperialists) came to
Burhanpur. Again, those wretches followed them and besieged Burhanpur,
and they were six months shut up there. Many parganas of the provinces
of Berar and Khandesh passed into their possession, and they stretched
out the hand of oppression over the cultivators and poor, and engaged
in collecting the revenues. As the army had undergone great hardships
and the animals had fallen into bad condition, they could not leave the
city to inflict substantial punishment. Thus the pride and conceit of
those short-sighted ones became greater. Just at this time the royal
standards returned to the capital, and by the grace of God
K&#257;ng&#7771;a was conquered.</p>
<p class="par">Accordingly, on Friday, the 4th of Dai, I despatched
K&#863;hurram in that direction, bestowing on him a dress of honour, a
sword, and an elephant. N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam also gave him an
elephant. I told him after he had conquered the province of the Deccan
he should take as a reward two<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6184src"
href="#xd24e6184" name="xd24e6184src">179</a> crores of dams from the

addition to the 31,000 horse already in that quarter, and a large force
of artillery, and many elephants, were appointed to accompany him. I
also gave him a crore of rupees for the expenses of the victorious
army. The servants (of the Court) who were appointed on this duty
received each, according to his standing as a reward, horses,
elephants, and dresses of honour.</p>
<p class="par">At the same auspicious hour and favourable time, the
standards of the expedition were turned toward Agra, and a halt was
made at Naus&#863;hahr.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6198src" href=

some of the mansabdars who had obtained leave to go to the conquest of
the Deccan were promoted as follows: Z&#257;hid K. held the mansab of
1,000 and 400 horse; he received that of 1,000 and 500 horse;
Hard&#299; Nar&#257;yan H&#257;&#7693;&#257; I promoted to 900 and 600
horse, original and increased; Ya&#703;q&#363;b, s. K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, was given that of 800 and 400 horse, and in the same
manner a great number of the servants of the State received increase of
mansab according to their capabilities. Mu&#703;tamid K. was appointed
to the post of Bakhshi and newswriter to the royal army, and was
honoured with a <i>t&#363;g&#863;h</i>. The offering of Lachm&#299;
Chand, Raja of Kumaon, consisting of hawks and falcons and other
hunting animals, was brought before me. Jagat Singh, s. R&#257;n&#257;
Karan, obtained leave to proceed as an auxiliary to the army of the
Deccan, being presented with a private horse and saddle. R&#257;ja
R&#363;p Chand, having been honoured with the gift of an elephant and a
horse, took leave to go to his jagir. On the 12th my son
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n (Lod&#299;) was made governor of Multan, and
was given leave. There were conferred on him a complete dress together
with a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> (a robe of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s
invention), a jewelled dagger, a special elephant with trappings, a
female elephant, a special horse of the name of K&#863;hadang
(<i>i.e.</i>, Arrow), and a pair of hawks. Sayyid Hizabr K. held the
mansab of 1,000 and 400 horse. Increasing these by 500 and 200 horse, I
gave him leave to accompany K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. Muh&#803;ammad
S&#863;haf&#299;&#703; was appointed Bakhshi and newswriter to the
Subah of Multan. Bhaw&#257;l (or Bahw&#257;l), who was one of the old
servants, was made <i>As&#863;hraf-i-t&#363;p-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>
(head of the artillery?), and received the title of R&#257;y. On the
13th the bank of the river Gobindw&#257;l became the camp of the army
of prosperity, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>and a halt of four days was made. A special
elephant called Jai Singh, with a female, were given to Mah&#257;bat
K., and sent to him by &#7778;afiyy&#257; his servant. Robes of honour
were also forwarded to the Amirs of the Subah of Bangash by
&#703;Is&#257; Beg.</p>
<p class="par">On the 17th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6229src" href=
"#xd24e6229" name="xd24e6229src">183</a> the feast of my lunar weighing
took place. As Mu&#703;tamid K. had been appointed Bakhshi to the army
of the Deccan and given leave, the post of &#703;Arz&#803;-muqarrir was
given to K&#863;hw&#257;ja Q&#257;sim. M&#299;r S&#863;haraf was made
Bakhshi of the Ah&#803;ad&#299;s, and F&#257;z&#803;il Beg made Bakhshi
of the Panjab. As Bah&#257;dur K., governor of Qandahar, in consequence
of a disease in his eyes, had requested to be allowed to kiss the
threshold, entrusting the government of Qandahar this day to
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K., an order was issued to Bah&#257;dur
K., that when he arrived he should hand over the fort to him and come
himself to Court. On the 21st of the same month I took up my quarters
at N&#363;r-sar&#257;y.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6235src" href=
"#xd24e6235" name="xd24e6235src">184</a> At this spot the Vakils of
N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam had built a lofty house, and made a royal
garden. It was now completed. On this account the Begam, having begged
for an entertainment, prepared a grand feast, and by way of offering,
with great pains produced all kinds of delicate and rare things. In
order to please her, I took what I approved. I halted two days at this
place. It was settled that the officials of the Panjab should send Rs.
200,000, in addition to the Rs. 60,000 already ordered for provisions
for the fort of Qandahar. M&#299;r Qiw&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, the diwan of
the Panjab, obtained leave to go to Lahore, and received a dress of
honour. Q&#257;sim K., with a view to punish the <span class=

K&#257;ng&#7771;a, and to preserve order in those regions, was given
leave to go, and I presented him with a special
<i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i>, a horse, a dagger, and an elephant. His
mansab, original and increased, was fixed at 2,000 personal and 500
horse. At his request, I allowed R&#257;ja Sangr&#257;m (of Jammu) to
proceed to that region, conferring on him a robe of honour, a horse,
and an elephant.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday the camp was pitched outside the town of
Sihrind. I halted one day, and amused myself with going round the
garden. On Sunday, the 4th, Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan was sent on service
for the conquest of the Deccan. A dress of honour, with a
<i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i>, a special shawl, an elephant named
&#7778;ubh&#803;-dam (breath of morn), a horsetail banner, and drums,
being given him. I gave leave to Mu&#703;tamid K., presenting him with
a dress of honour, and a special horse called
&#7778;ubh&#803;-i-&#7779;&#257;diq (the true dawn). On the 7th of the
same month the bank of the river Sarasat&#299; (Saraswat&#299;) was the
place of encampment of good fortune in the neighbourhood of the
<i>qa&#7779;ba</i> of mu&#7779;&#7789;af&#257;&#702;&#257;b&#257;d. The
next day I encamped at Akbarp&#363;r,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6251src" href="#xd24e6251" name="xd24e6251src">185</a> whence I
sat in a boat on the river Jumna, to reach my object. On this day
&#703;Izzat K. Ch&#257;ch&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6254src"
href="#xd24e6254" name="xd24e6254src">186</a> with the faujd&#257;r of
that region, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Giving
Muh&#803;ammad S&#863;haf&#299;&#703; leave to proceed to Multan, I
presented him with a horse, a dress of honour, and a
<i>n&#363;r-s&#863;h&#257;h&#299; muhar</i>, and sent by him a special
turban (<i>ch&#299;ra</i>) to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, my son
(<i>farzand</i>).</p>
<p class="par">Thence, in five marches, I reached the pargana of
Kir&#257;na, the native country of Muqarrab K., and the Court encamped
there. By way of offering, his Vakils laid before me 91 rubies<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6272src" href="#xd24e6272" name=
"xd24e6272src">187</a> and 4 diamonds, 1,000 gaz of
<i>mik&#863;hmal</i> (satin) as a <i>p&#257;-and&#257;z</i>
(foot-carpet), with a petition from him, presenting also 100 camels as
charity. I ordered them to be distributed among deserving people. From
this place, in five marches Delhi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194"
href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>became the halting-place of
the standards of good fortune I sent It&#703;im&#257;du-d-daula to my
fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z with a special
<i>farj&#299;</i> (a dress), for him, and it was settled that he should
return in the space of one month and wait on me. Having halted for two
days at Sal&#299;mga&#7771;h, on Thursday, the 23rd, I passed through
the district of Delhi with the intention of hunting in the pargana of
P&#257;lam, and halted on the bank of the S&#863;hams&#299; tank. On
the road I scattered 4,000 <i>charans</i> (Rs. 1,000) with my own hand.
Twenty-two elephants, male and female, had arrived from Bengal as an
offering from Allah-y&#257;r, s. Iftik&#863;h&#257;r K., and were
passed before me.</p>

government salt works at Sambhar, a duty which he performed
efficiently. He was now appointed to the faudjarship of that region. He

presented a loving letter from that noble brother, together with a
black and white plume (<i>kalg&#299;-i-ablaq</i>), valued by the
jewellers at Rs. 50,000. My brother also sent me a ruby weighing 12

had this ruby inserted in a <i>j&#299;g&#863;ha</i> (turban ornament),

K&#863;hurram, and sent it to him.</p>
<p class="par">On Saturday, the 1st of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817;, I
marched from Sal&#299;mga&#7771;h, and going first to the glorious
mausoleum of Hum&#257;y&#363;n (may the lights of Allah be his
testimony!), performed the dues of humility, and presented 2,000
quarter rupees (<i>charan</i>) to those who sat in seclusion in that
pure cemetery. I encamped twice on the bank of the Jumna in the
environs of the city. Sayyid Hizabr K.,<a class="noteref" id=

been appointed an auxiliary to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, was sent off
with the distinction of a dress of honour, a sword, a dagger, a horse,
and a standard. Sayyids &#703;&#256;lim and
&#703;Abdu-l-H&#257;d&#299;, his brothers, were also each honoured with
a horse and a dress of honour. M&#299;r Baraka Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299;
was allowed to go to Transoxiana. I entrusted Rs. 10,000 to him, 5,000
of them to be conveyed to K&#863;hw&#257;ja &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;
Dihb&#299;d&#299;, who from his fathers was one of the well-wishers of

<i>muj&#257;wirs</i> (custodians) attached to the tomb of
T&#299;m&#363;r (may the lights of Allah be his testimony!). I also
gave a special turban (<i>ch&#299;ra</i>) to Mah&#257;bat K., and sent
it to him by M&#299;r Baraka. I also ordered M&#299;r Baraka to make
every effort to procure mottled fish-teeth, and to procure them from
any possible quarter, and at any price.</p>
<p class="par">I went by boat from Delhi, and in six stages reached the
plain of Brind&#257;ban. I gave an elephant to M&#299;r

selected to be M&#299;r T&#363;zuk (master of ceremonies) in the place
of Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K., and I presented him with a special shawl
(<i>parm-narm</i>). Next day, Gokul<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6383src"

opposite side of the Jumna. As the auspicious hour for entering the
city had been fixed for the 14th, I halted here, and at the selected
auspicious hour proceeded to the fort, and entered the palace happily
and victoriously. The propitious journey from Lahore to Agra was
accomplished in the period of two months and two<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">As Las&#863;hkar K. had satisfactorily performed his
duties at Agra, I increased his mansab by 1,000 personal and 500 horse,
and made it 4,000 personal and 2,500 horse, and sent him as an
auxiliary to the army of the Deccan. Sa&#703;&#299;d&#257;,
superintendent of the goldsmith&rsquo;s department, was dignified with
the title of B&#299;-badal K. Four horses, some silver ornaments and
cloths, which the ruler of Persia had sent me by &#256;q&#257; Beg and
Muh&#803;ammad Muh&#803;ibb &#703;Al&#299;, were produced before me on
this day. The entertainment of Thursday, the 20th, took place in the
N&#363;r-manzil garden. I gave a present of Rs. 1,00,000 to my son
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r. Muz&#804;affar K., according to order, came from
Thatta, and had the good fortune to wait on me. He offered 100 muhars
and Rs. 100. Las&#863;hkar K. produced a ruby as an offering. It was
valued at Rs. 4,000. A special horse of the name of
Mu&#7779;&#257;h&#803;ib (companion) was given to &#703;Abdu-llah K.
&#703;Abdu-s-Sal&#257;m, s. Mu&#703;az&#804;z&#804;am K., having
arrived from Orissa, had the good fortune to wait on me: 100 muhars and
Rs. 100 were laid before me as his <i>nazar</i>. The mansab of
D&#363;st Beg, s. T&#363;lak K., was fixed at <span class=

personal and 400 horse. The entertainment of Thursday, the 27th, was
held in the N&#363;r-afs&#863;h&#257;n garden. A special dress of
honour was given to M. Rustam, and a horse to his son, who was called
Dakhan&#299;, and a special horse and an elephant to Las&#863;hkar
K.</p>
<p class="par">On Friday, the 28th, I went to hunt to the village of
Samonagar, and returned at night. Seven Persian horses, with their
trappings, were laid before me as an offering from &#256;q&#257; Beg
and Muh&#803;ibb &#703;Al&#299;. I presented Zamb&#299;l Beg, the
ambassador, with a N&#363;r-jah&#257;n&#299; muhar of the weight of 100
<i>tolas</i>, and gave a jewelled penholder to &#7778;&#257;diq K., the

Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l, Jarrett, II. 347, puts Kashmir into the third
and fourth climates, but at Vol. III., p. 89, he puts Kashmir into the
fourth climate. Probably both he and Jah&#257;ng&#299;r mean by Kashmir
Srinagar. The appellation &ldquo;White Islands&rdquo; is probably a
mistake for &ldquo;The Fortunate Islands,&rdquo; <i>saf&#299;d</i>
(white) being written instead of <i>sa&#703;&#257;da</i>, which is the
word in the Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma.
<i>Jaz&#257;&#702;ir-i-Sa&#703;&#257;da</i> (&ldquo;The Fortunate
Isles&rdquo;) is also the expression used in the Z&#804;afar-n&#257;ma,
II. 178, which is probably the source of the &#256;y&#299;n and the
T&#363;zuk. In the extract from the Z&#804;afar-n&#257;ma given in the
T. Ras&#863;h&#299;d&#299; translation, 430, the longitude is given as
105&deg; from the &ldquo;Fortunate Islands.&rdquo; The <i>text</i> of
the &#256;y&#299;n, Bib. Ind. edition, II. 42, gives 105.40&deg; as the

is evidently the Qambarber of Jarrett, II. 347 and 361. It lies in the
south-east of Kashmir. Measured by the compass,
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s 67 is much more correct than
Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l&rsquo;s 120. The I.G. new edition gives the area
of Kashmir and Jammu as 80,900 square miles. Lawrence states the

word used by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r is <i>dara&#703;</i>, which is given by
Steingass as Arabic, and as meaning a yard. <i>Z&#817;ara&#703;</i>
again, is given as equal to a cubit. Clearly Jah&#257;ng&#299;r uses
the word here as equivalent to a <i>gaz</i> or yard, for he says that
there are 5,000 <i>dara&#703;</i> in the koss adopted by himself and
his father, and Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l in the &#256;y&#299;n (Jarrett,
II. 414) says the koss is 5,000 <i>gaz</i>. The word <i>dara&#703;</i>
is also rendered <i>gaz</i> in the Hindustani translation of the
Memoirs. There is an important discrepancy between the two I.O. MSS.
and the printed text of the Memoirs. The former, instead of saying that
the <i>dara&#703;</i> or yard is = 2 <i>s&#863;har&#703;&#299;
dara&#703;</i>, say that 1&frac14; <i>dara&#703;</i> are = 2
<i>s&#863;har&#703;&#299; dara&#703;</i>. In the &#256;y&#299;n
(Jarrett, II. 417) the <i>gaz</i> is given as equal to 24 digits. See
later on, p. 303 of text, where, in describing S&#863;h&#257;h
S&#863;huj&#257;&rsquo;s accident, 7 <i>dara&#703;</i> are said to be

number of boatmen at 33,870, and the boats, exclusive of private ones,
at 2,417. The revenue of Kashmir, as stated by Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, is
that mentioned in the &#256;y&#299;n, Jarrett, II. 366, and is
according to the assessment of Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;

Lawrence, 234, are taken apparently from the Persian text (compare Bib.

is the Kashmiri name for the Jhelam (Lawrence, 18). It is contracted
from Vitasta. It is curious that the date of the festival should be
given according to a Muhammadan month (S&#863;haww&#257;l), which must
recur at different seasons. Apparently the meaning is that the birth of
the Jhelam took place on that day.</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">Apparently the festival is not much
celebrated nowadays, for it is not mentioned by Lawrence
(264&ndash;266), except that in a note to p. 266 the Vathtrwah is
mentioned as a day on which daughters receive presents. The 19th
S&#863;hahr&#299;war, the corresponding date mentioned by
Jah&#257;ng&#299;r, would answer to the end of August or beginning of
September, and to the Hindu month of &#256;sin. 13 S&#863;haww&#257;l,
1029, would correspond to 1 September, 1620. Possibly the
S&#863;haww&#257;l of text is a mistake for the Hindu month
S&#257;wan&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Sr&#257;van. The legend of the birth of
the Jhelam is told in Stein, 97. Possibly S&#863;haww&#257;l does not
here mean the month, and we should read

The Iqb&#257;l-n&#257;ma 159 and the MSS. show that the text has
omitted a negative, and that the list consists of Indian birds which
are <i>not</i> met with in Kashmir. Several of the names do not occur
in the dictionaries. No 2 (the s&#257;ras) is described in
Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, 321. No. 4 is the florikan, or <i lang="la">Otis
Bengalensis</i>. For Nos. 5&ndash;7 see Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, 321.
Karaw&#257;n is a crane in Arabic, apparently, and so Karw&#257;nak
should be a little crane. It is also described as a kind of partridge.
Perhaps the Karw&#257;nak is the demoiselle crane. No. 9 may be the
oriole, or mango-bird, but that, too, is common in Kashm&#299;r. For
No. 12, which may be the ibis, see Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, 322. For No.
14 see Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, p. 321, and for No. 18 Babur&rsquo;s

viridis</i>). For No. 23 see Babur&rsquo;s Memoirs, 267 and 321. No. 25
may be one of the parrots, as H&#803;&#257;fiz&#804; called the Indian

Rab&#299;&#703;u-l-&#257;k&#863;hir, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1030
(10 March, 1621), the sun that bestows bounty on the world lit up the
abode of fortune of Aries with his world-illuminating light, and
gladdened the world and its inhabitants. The sixteenth year of the
reign of this suppliant at the throne of Allah commenced with gladness
and victory, and at the auspicious hour and blessed time I sat on the
throne of success in the capital of Agra. On this joy-enhancing day my
fortunate son S&#863;hahriy&#257;r lifted up his head with the honour
of the mansab of 8,000 and 4,000 horse. My revered father bestowed, for
the first time, this mansab<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6476src" href=
"#xd24e6476" name="xd24e6476src">2</a> on my brothers. It is hoped that
in the shadow of my education and in carrying out my pleasure, he may
reach the extreme of life and prosperity. On this day B&#257;qir K.
arrayed his men and passed them before me in order. The great Bakhshis
recorded (the number as) 1,000 horse and 2,000 foot, and reported to
me. Having promoted him to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,000
horse, I entrusted the duties of faujd&#257;r of Agra to him.</p>
<p class="par">On Wednesday, together with the ladies seated in a boat,
I went to the N&#363;r-afs&#863;h&#257;n garden, and rested there at
night. As the garden belongs to the establishment of N&#363;r
Jah&#257;n B., on Thursday, the 4th, she held the royal<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6481src" href="#xd24e6481" name="xd24e6481src">3</a>
entertainment and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span>presented great offerings. Of jewels,
jewelled ornaments, and all sorts of precious goods, I selected what I
approved of, of the value of Rs. 100,000. During these days, every day
after midday I embarked in a boat, and went to Samonagar, 4 koss
distant from the city, for sport, returning to the palace at night.
Sending R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo to my prosperous son S&#863;h&#257;h
Parw&#299;z, I sent with him a special dress of honour, with a jewelled
belt, which contained a sapphire<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6486src"
href="#xd24e6486" name="xd24e6486src">4</a> and several rubies. As I
had given Behar to that son in the place of Muqarrab K., I started off
a <i>saz&#257;wul</i> to conduct him from Allahabad to Behar. M&#299;r
Z&#257;hid,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6494src" href="#xd24e6494" name=
"xd24e6494src">5</a> son-in-law of Muz&#804;affar K., having come from
Thatta, waited on me. As M&#299;r &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daula<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6498src" href="#xd24e6498" name="xd24e6498src">6</a>
had become very old and decrepit, he could not carry out the duties of
the camp and his jagir. I released him from the trouble of service and
active work. I ordered that he should receive Rs. 4,000 every month out
of the public treasury, and living at ease and in comfort at Agra or
Lahore, or wherever he wished, should employ himself in prayers for my
increased life and welfare.</p>
<p class="par">On the 9th Farward&#299;n the offering of
I&#703;tib&#257;r K. was laid before me. Of jewels, cloths, etc., the
value of Rs. 70,000, was accepted, and I returned the remainder to him.
Muh&#803;ibb &#703;Al&#299; and &#256;q&#257; Beg, envoys of the ruler
of Persia, presented twenty-four horses, two mules, three camels, seven
greyhounds (<i>sag-i-t&#257;z&#299;</i>), twenty-seven pieces
(<i>t&#804;&#257;q</i>) of brocade, a
<i>s&#863;ham&#257;ma</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6511src" href=
"#xd24e6511" name="xd24e6511src">7</a> of ambergris, two pairs of
carpets, and two <i>namad takya</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6516src"
href="#xd24e6516" name="xd24e6516src">8</a> (woollen coverlets). Two
mares with foals that my brother had sent with them were also brought
before me.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, at the request of &#256;&#7779;af K., I
went to his house with the ladies. Having prepared a grand
entertainment, he submitted to me many delicate gems and wonders in
cloths, and rare gifts. Choosing out of these to the value of Rs.
130,000, I gave the rest to him. Mukarram K., governor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>of
Orissa, sent by way of offering thirty-two elephants, male and female,
and these had the honour of being accepted. At this time I saw a wild
ass<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6523src" href="#xd24e6523" name=
"xd24e6523src">9</a> (<i>g&#363;r-k&#863;har</i>), exceedingly strange
in appearance, exactly like a lion. From the tip of the nose to the end
of the tail, and from the point of the ear to the top of the hoof,
black markings, large or small, suitable to their position, were seen
on it. Round the eyes there was an exceedingly fine black line. One
might say the painter of fate, with a strange brush, had left it on the
page of the world. As it was strange, some people imagined that it had
been coloured. After minute inquiry into the truth, it became known
that the Lord of the world was the Creator thereof. As it was a rarity,
it was included among the royal gifts sent to my brother
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s. Bah&#257;dur K. Uzbeg had sent as an
offering some tipch&#257;q horses and cloth stuffs from
&#703;Ir&#257;q, and they were produced before me. Dresses of honour
for the winter were sent for Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang and
the Amirs of Bengal by M&#363;min S&#863;h&#299;r&#257;z&#299;. On the
15th the offering of &#7778;&#257;diq K. was produced. It was of all
sorts. Having taken what was worth Rs. 15,000, I gave the remainder to
him. F&#257;z&#803;il K. on this day also gave an offering according to
his condition. Of this a trifle was taken. On Thursday (19th
Farward&#299;n) the feast of the culmination was held, and when two
watches and one <i>g&#863;ha&#7771;&#299;</i> of the day had passed, I
took my seat on the throne. According to the request of
Mad&#257;r-ul-mulk I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula, the feast of the
culmination was held in his house. He presented a remarkable offering
of rare and choice things from all countries. Altogether I took the
value of Rs. 138,000. On this day I gave Zambil Beg, the ambassador, a
muhar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6538src" href="#xd24e6538" name=
"xd24e6538src">10</a> equal to 200 <i>tolas</i> in weight. At this time
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. had sent some eunuchs from Bengal. One of these
was a hermaphrodite. Among the offerings of the above-mentioned were
two boats <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>made in Bengal, of a very pleasant shape, on the
decoration of which a sum of Rs. 10,000 had been expended. They were
really kingly boats. Having made S&#863;haik&#863;h Q&#257;sim K.
governor of Allahabad, I honoured him with the title of
Muh&#803;tas&#863;him K. and the mansab of 5,000, and gave an order
that the Diwans should give him an increase to his jagir out of the
unappropriated (<i>mah&#803;&#257;ll-i-ghair-i-&#703;amal&#299;</i>)
estates. R&#257;ja S&#863;hy&#257;m Singh, Zamindar of Sr&#299;nagar
(in Garhw&#257;l) was given a horse and an elephant.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that Y&#363;suf K.,
s. H&#803;usain K.,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6552src" href=
"#xd24e6552" name="xd24e6552src">11</a> had died in the victorious army
of the Deccan a sudden death. The report said that when he was at his
jagir he had become so fat that he got out of breath with the least
exertion. One day when he was paying his respects to K&#863;hurram, in
coming and going his breathing<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6555src"
href="#xd24e6555" name="xd24e6555src">12</a> became difficult. When a
dress of honour was given him, in putting it on and saluting he became
helpless, and a trembling affected all his limbs, and with a hundred
labours and exertions he saluted and stumbled out and fell under the
shelter of the tent enclosure, and became unconscious. His servants
placed him in a palanquin, and took him home, and as he arrived, the
messenger of death came also. He received his command, and left his
heavy lump of earth in the perishable dustbin. On 1st
Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, I gave a special dagger to Zambil Beg, the
ambassador. On the 4th of the same month the feast of the
<i>k&#257;r-i-khair</i> (consummation of marriage) of my son
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r increased the joy of my heart. The
H&#803;inna-band&#299; (putting on henna) assembly took place in the
palace of Maryamu-z-zam&#257;n&#299;. The feast of the
<i>nik&#257;h&#803;</i> (marriage) was held in the house of
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula. I myself went there with the ladies and
adorned the feast of joy. After seven gharis of night had passed, on
Friday<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6565src" href="#xd24e6565" name=
"xd24e6565src">13</a> the marriage took place with rejoicings. I hope
that it will be propitious to this daily-increasing State. On Tuesday,
the 19th, in the N&#363;r-afs&#863;h&#257;n garden, I presented my son
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r with a jewelled <i>ch&#257;rqab</i> (coat), with a
turban and waist-belt (<i>kamar-band</i>), <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>and
two horses, one an &#703;Ir&#257;q&#299;, with a gold saddle, and the
other a Turk&#299;, with an embroidered saddle.</p>
<p class="par">In these days S&#863;h&#257;h S&#863;huj&#257;&#703; had
an eruption so violent that water would not go down his throat, and his
life was despaired of. As it had been recorded in his father&rsquo;s
horoscope that his son would die this year, all the astrologers were
unanimous that he would not live, but Jotik R&#257;y said, on the
contrary, that the dust of calamity would not settle on the skirt of
his life. I asked: &ldquo;By what proof?&rdquo; He said that in the
horoscope of my destiny it was recorded that in this year no distress
or trouble would find its way to the royal mind from any road, and as I
had a great affection for the child, it behoved that no calamity should
happen to him, and some other child would die. It came to pass as he
said, and he carried his life out of this deadly place, and a son that
he (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n) had by the daughter of
S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K., died at Burhanpur. Besides this, many of
Jotik R&#257;y&rsquo;s judgments (ah&#803;k&#257;m) turned out correct.
This is not without strangeness, and it is therefore recorded in these
memoirs. I accordingly ordered him (Jotik R&#257;y) to be weighed
against money and the weight came to Rs. 6,500. This was given him as a
reward.</p>
<p class="par">Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain J&#257;bir&#299; was
appointed Bakhshi and newswriter of the Subah of Orissa. The mansab of
L&#257;ch&#299;n Munajjim (astrologer) Q&#257;qs&#863;h&#257;l, at the
request of Mah&#257;bat K., was fixed, original and increased, at 1,000
personal and 500 horse. Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;usain, brother of
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, came from K&#257;ng&#7771;a and waited on
me. Having presented an elephant to Bah&#257;dur K. Uzbeg, I sent it
with his Vakil. Hurmuz and H&#363;s&#863;hang, grandsons of the asylum
of pardon M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad H&#803;ak&#299;m, by reason of
the caution that is fitting to rulers, had been imprisoned in the fort
of Gwalior. At this time, having summoned them into my presence, I
ordered them to remain in Agra, and a daily allowance sufficient for
their expenses was allowed for them. At this time a brahman of the name
of R&#363;dar Bhattach&#257;raj, who was one of the learned ones of
this caste, and was engaged at Benares in teaching, had the good
fortune to pay his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204"
name="pb204">204</a>]</span>respects to me. In truth, he has studied
well, both in the rational and traditional sciences, and is perfect in
his own line.</p>
<p class="par">One of the strange events of this time<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6585src" href="#xd24e6585" name="xd24e6585src">14</a> was that
on 30 Farward&#299;n (about 10 April, 1621) in the present year, in a
certain village of the pargana of J&#257;landhar, in the morning, a
terrible noise arose from the East, such that its inhabitants, from
fright at that terror-increasing sound, nearly deserted their bodies.
Whilst this noise and disturbance were going on, a light fell from
above on the ground, and the people thought that fire was raining down
from heaven. After a moment, when that noise ceased, and their troubled
hearts recovered from their bewilderment and terror, they sent a quick
runner to the collector (<i>&#703;&#257;mil</i>) Muh&#803;ammad
Sa&#703;&#299;d, and informed him of what had occurred. He immediately
rode there himself, and went to look at the spot. For ten or twelve
yards in length and breadth the land was so burnt that no trace of any
grass or green was left, and there were still signs of heat and
burning. He ordered them to dig up the soil, and the more they dug the
greater the heat appeared to be till they came to a place where a piece
of heated iron appeared. It was as hot as if it had been taken out of a
furnace. After a while it became cold, and taking it up, he conveyed it
to his house, and placing it in a <i>k&#863;har&#299;&#7789;a</i>
(cover), which he sealed, he sent it to Court. I ordered them to weigh
it in my presence, and it came to 160 <i>tolas</i>. I ordered Master
(Ust&#257;d) D&#257;&#702;&#363;d<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6597src"
href="#xd24e6597" name="xd24e6597src">15</a> to make a sword, a dagger,
and a knife of it, and bring them to me. He represented that it would
not stand below the hammer, and fell to pieces. I told him in that case
to mix it with other iron and make use of it. As I had told him, he
mixed three parts of lightning-iron and one of other iron, and having

Allahabad to Behar. I hope he will be prosperous (there). Q&#257;sim K.

K&#863;hurd&#257;d, Afz&#803;al K., K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s Diwan brought
a letter from him containing the good news of his victory, and kissed
the threshold. The details are as follows: When the victorious army
reached Ujain, a band of the servants of the Court, who were in the
fort of M&#257;nd&#363;, sent a report that an army of the rebels,
putting forward the foot of audacity, had crossed the Narbad&#257;, and
burning several villages that were under<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6661src" href="#xd24e6661" name="xd24e6661src">20</a> the fort,
were busy with rapine and plunder. Mad&#257;ru-l-mah&#257;mm
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, with 5,000 cavalry, were
appointed to go in all haste and inflict punishment on that vain lot of
people. The K&#863;hw&#257;ja made a night march, and at the dawn of
day reached the bank of the Narbad&#257;. When the enemy learnt this,
they in one moment threw themselves into the river and reached the bank
of safety. The brave cavalry galloped after them, and pursued them for
nearly 4 koss,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6664src" href="#xd24e6664"
name="xd24e6664src">21</a> and with the sword of vengeance, made many
of them travellers on the road of non-existence. The ill-fated rebels
did not turn back the reins of haste till they reached Burhanpur.
K&#863;hurram wrote to Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan to remain on that (the
South) side of the river till he came. Soon he, with his army, joined
this advanced force, and hastened on, march by march, till he reached
Burhanpur. The graceless rebels were still keeping<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6667src" href="#xd24e6667" name="xd24e6667src">22</a> their
ground, and were encamped round the city. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>As the imperial
servants had been contending with the rebels for two years, they had
suffered much hardship from want of land
(<i>b&#299;-j&#257;g&#299;r&#299;</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6703src" href="#xd24e6703" name="xd24e6703src">23</a>
non-possession of fiefs, landlessness) and scarcity of corn, and their
horses were worn out by continued service. Accordingly, they had to
delay nine days in order to recruit. During this period, thirty lakhs
of rupees and many cuirasses<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6709src" href=
"#xd24e6709" name="xd24e6709src">24</a> were distributed among the
soldiers, and <i>saz&#257;wuls</i> had been sent out and had brought
many men out of the city (Burhanpur). The gallant troops had not yet
put their hands to the work, when the black-fated rebels felt that they
could not resist, and scattered like &ldquo;the daughters of the
Bier&rdquo; (the stars of the constellation of the Great Bear, which
are dispersed over the heavens, instead of being clustered like the
Pleiades). The brave and swift cavaliers followed them, and with the
sword of vengeance cast many of them upon the earth of perdition. They
gave them no rest, but smiting and slaying them, pursued them as far as
Khirk&#299;, which was the residence of the Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk
and the other rebels. One day before this the ill-starred one (Malik
&#703;Ambar) had got information of the approach of the imperialists,
and had removed the Niz&#804;&#257;mu-l-mulk and his family and effects
to the fort of Daulat&#257;b&#257;d. There he had encamped, with his
back resting on the fort, while in front of him there were marshes and
quagmires.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6730src" href="#xd24e6730" name=
"xd24e6730src">25</a> Most of his men became scattered in all
directions. The leaders of the victorious army, with their
vengeance-seeking soldiers, halted three days in the town of
Khirk&#299;, and so destroyed a city <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>which had taken
twenty years to build, that it is not known if it will regain its
splendour in other twenty years. In fine, after throwing down its
buildings, all agreed in opinion that as an army of rebels was still
besieging Ahmadnagar, they must at once go there, and inflict condign
punishment on the originators of the disturbance, renew the supplies
(of the Ahmadnagar garrison), and leave assistance there, and then
return. With this view they set out, and came as far as the town of
Pa&#7789;an (in Berar, Jarrett II. 233). Meanwhile, the crafty
&#703;Ambar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6748src" href="#xd24e6748" name=
"xd24e6748src">26</a> sent agents and officers, and said: &ldquo;After
this I will not drop the thread of service and loyalty from my hand,
nor put out my foot beyond orders, and will regard whatever tribute and
fine be commanded as a favour, and will send it to the
government.&rdquo; It happened that just then there was great scarcity
in the camp in consequence of the dearness of provisions, and also that
news came that the rebel force which was besieging Ahmadnagar had
withdrawn on hearing of the approach of the imperialists. Accordingly,
a force was sent to help K&#863;hanjar K. (the governor of Fort
Ahmadnagar), and a sum of money for his charges. Thereupon the
imperialists were relieved from all anxiety and returned (across the
Narbad&#257;?). After much entreaty and lamentation (on the part of
&#703;Ambar) it was settled that in addition to the territory which of
old had belonged to the empire, the rebels should surrender 14 koss of
the adjoining country, and should pay into the public treasury fifty
lakhs of rupees as tribute.</p>
<p class="par">I gave Afz&#803;al K. (S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s diwan) leave to return, and sent with him, for
K&#863;hurram, the ruby plume (<i>kalg&#299;-i-la&#703;l&#299;</i>)
which the King of Persia had sent to me, and which has been already
described, and I gave to the aforesaid (Afz&#803;al) a dress of honour,
an elephant, an inkpot, and a jewelled pen. K&#863;hanjar K., who, when
besieged in the Fort of Ahmadnagar, had performed approved services,
and shown proper activity, was promoted to the mansab of 4,000 personal
and 1,000 horse.</p>
<p class="par">Mukarram K., having come by order from Orissa, had,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>with his brothers, the good fortune to wait upon
me. He presented a string of pearls by way of offering.
Muz&#804;affaru-l-mulk, s. Bah&#257;duru-l-mulk, was honoured with the
title of Nu&#7779;rat K. A standard was conferred on &#362;d&#257;
R&#257;m, Dakhan&#299;, and to &#703;Az&#299;zu-llah, s. Y&#363;suf K.,
was given the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse. On Thursday, the
21st, Muqarrab K. arrived from Behar, and had the good fortune to wait
upon me. At this time &#256;q&#257; &#703;Al&#299;, Muh&#803;ibb
&#703;Al&#299; Beg, H&#803;&#257;j&#299; Beg, and F&#257;z&#803;il Beg,
the envoys of the ruler of Persia, who had come at different times,
were allowed to depart. To &#256;q&#257; Beg I made a present of a
dress of honour, a jewelled dagger, and Rs. 40,000 in cash; to
Muh&#803;ibb &#703;Al&#299; Beg a dress of honour and Rs. 30,000; and
to the others in the same way I presented gifts according to their
positions. I also sent a suitable souvenir by them to my brother. On
this day Mukarram K. was appointed Subahdar of Delhi, and faujd&#257;r
of Mew&#257;t. S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K. &#703;Arab was dignified
with the mansab of 3,000 personal and 2,500 horse, original and
increased; S&#863;harza K. with that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse; Girdhar,
s. R&#257;y S&#257;l Kachhw&#257;ha, with that of 1,200 and 900
horse.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th, Q&#257;sim Beg, an envoy of the ruler of
Persia, came and waited on me, bringing a letter from that brother of
lofty dignity, containing expressions of sincerity and friendship. What
he had sent by way of royal gifts was laid before me. On the 1st of
T&#299;r, I sent a special elephant called Gaj Ratan, for my son
(<i>farzand</i>) K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n. Naz&#804;ar Beg, a servant
of K&#863;hurram, laid before me a letter from him asking for the gift
of horses. I ordered R&#257;ja Kis&#863;han D&#257;s, the mus&#863;hrif
(accountant) to prepare within fifteen days 1,000 horses from the royal
stables, and to send them off with him. I sent to K&#863;hurram as a
present a horse of the name of R&#363;m-ratan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6768src" href="#xd24e6768" name="xd24e6768src">27</a> (&ldquo;the
jewel of Turkey&rdquo;), which the ruler of Persia had sent me out of
the spoils of the Turkish camp.</p>
<p class="par">On this day a servant of Ir&#257;dat K., of the name of
G&#863;hiy&#257;s&#804;u-d-d&#299;n, laid before me a report from him
containing the good news of his victory. In the preceding pages there
has been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>written with the pen of demonstration an account
of the rebellion of the Zamindars of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r and of the
despatch of Jal&#257;l, s. Dil&#257;war K. As this important matter had
not been properly managed by him, an order was given to Ir&#257;dat K.
to hasten to take up that duty, and to inflict severe punishment on the
rebels, and make such arrangements in the hill-country that the dust of
dispersion and calamity might not settle on its frontiers. He, as
ordered, hastened there and did approved service, and the people of
sedition and disturbance, having turned their heads towards the desert
of exile, escaped half dead. Thus once more was the thorn of calamity
and mischief rooted out of that country, and having established the
officials and established posts, he returned to Kashmir. As a reward
for this service I added 500 horse to his mansab.</p>
<p class="par">As K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan had done
good service and shown proper activity in the affair of the Deccan, I
increased his mansab by 1,000 horse. Ah&#803;mad Beg, nephew of
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. Fath&#803;-jang, being exalted to the Subahdarship
of Orissa, was dignified with the title of <i>K&#863;h&#257;n</i>, and
had given him a standard and drums. His mansab also was raised to 2,000
with 500 horse.</p>
<p class="par">As I had often heard of the virtues and good qualities
of Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; Na&#7779;&#299;r of Burhanpur, my truth-seeking
mind had a desire for his society. At this time he came, according to
summons, to the Court. Doing honour to his learning, I paid him great
regard. The Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; is one of the unique of the age for
rational and traditional sciences, and there are few books that he has
not read, but his exterior did not agree with his interior, and I could
not be delighted with his company. As I found him much devoted to being
a dervish and seclusion, I respected his feelings, and did not give him
the trouble of serving me. I gave him Rs. 5,000, and dismissed him to
his native country to pass his days in ease.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of the Divine month of Amurd&#257;d
B&#257;qir K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 personal and 1,200
horse, and of the Amirs and royal servants who had distinguished
themselves in the conquest of the Deccan, thirty-two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=

raised. &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K. Naqs&#863;hband&#299;, who had
been appointed to the governorship of Qandahar at the request of my son
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, was promoted to that of 3,000 personal and
2,000 horse. On the 1st S&#863;hahr&#299;war I gave the ambassador
Zambil Beg a jewelled sword, and also presented him with a village
under the jurisdiction of the capital, the revenue of which was Rs.
16,000.</p>
<p class="par">At this time, knowing that he was unfit for duty on
account of his bad temper and want of knowledge, I dismissed
H&#803;ak&#299;m Rukn&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6791src" href=
"#xd24e6791" name="xd24e6791src">28</a> and told him he might go
wherever he wished. As it was reported to me that H&#363;s&#863;hang,
the brother&rsquo;s son of K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, had
committed an unjust murder, having summoned him to my presence, I
investigated the charge, and after it was established, gave an order
for his execution. God forbid that in such affairs I should consider
princes, and far less that I should consider Amirs. I hope that the
grace of God may support me in this. On 1st S&#863;hahr&#299;war, at
the request of &#256;&#7779;af K., I went to his house and bathed in
the bath-house that he has lately built. It is beautifully finished.
After I had done bathing he laid before me offerings fit for a
<i>naz&#817;ar</i>. I took what I approved of and gave him the rest.
The <i>Waz&#804;&#299;fa</i> (pension) of K&#863;hiz&#803;r
K&#863;h&#257;n (late ruler) of Khandesh, was fixed at Rs.

<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that a blacksmith of
the name of Kaly&#257;n was much in love with a woman of his own caste,
and was always laying his head at her feet, and showing symptoms of
infatuation. The woman, though she was a widow, would in no way consent
to accept him, and the love of this wretch who had given his heart to
her made no impression on her. Having summoned both of them into my
presence, I cross-examined them, and however much I advised her to
unite herself to him, she did not agree. At this time the blacksmith
said that if he could make sure that I would<a class="noteref" id=

S&#863;h&#257;h-burj of the fort. I said by way of jest: &ldquo;Never
mind the S&#863;h&#257;h-burj; if your love be genuine, fling yourself
from the roof of this house, and I&rsquo;ll make her submit herself to
you.&rdquo; I had not ended before he ran like lightning and threw
himself down. When he fell, blood began to flow from his eyes and
mouth. I repented myself greatly of that jest, and was grieved in my
mind, and bade &#256;&#7779;af K&#863;h&#257;n take him to his house
and look after him. As the cup of his life was brimming over, he died
from the injury.</p>

<p class="par">It has been mentioned<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6823src" href="#xd24e6823" name="xd24e6823src">31</a> that on the
day of the Dasahara festival in Kashmir, I had perceived in myself a
catching and shortness of breath. Briefly, from excessive rain and the
dampness of the air, a difficulty in drawing breath showed itself on my
left side near the heart. This by degrees increased and became
intensified. Of the physicians who were in waiting on me,
H&#803;ak&#299;m R&#363;h&#803;u-llah first tried his remedies, and for
some time warm, soothing medicines were of use, for there was evidently
a slight diminution (of the symptoms). When I came down from the hills,
they came on again violently. This time for some days I took
goats&rsquo; milk, and again camel&rsquo;s milk, but I found no profit
whatever from them. About this time H&#803;ak&#299;m Rukn&#257;, who
had been excused from the journey to Kashmir, and whom I had left at
Agra, joined me, and confidently and with a show of power, undertook my
cure, and relied on warm and dry medicines. From his remedies, too, I
derived no advantage; on the contrary, they appeared to increase the
heat and dryness of my brain and temperament, and I became very weak.
The disease increased and the pain was prolonged. At such a time and in
this state, at which a heart of stone would have burnt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>(been distressed) about me,

Muh&#803;ammad, who was one of the chief physicians of Persia (was in
attendance on me). He had come from Persia in the reign of my revered
father, and after the throne of rule had been adorned by this
suppliant, as he was distinguished above all others by natural skill
and experience (<i>ta&#7779;arruf-i-t&#804;ab&#299;&#703;at</i>), I was
attended to by him, and I distinguished him with the title of
Mas&#299;h&#803;u-z-zam&#257;n (Messiah of the Age). I made his
position more honourable than that of the other Court-physicians, with
the idea that at some crisis he would help me. That ungrateful man, in
spite of the claims which I had on him, though he saw me in such a
state, did not give me medicines or treat me. Notwithstanding that I
distinguished him beyond all the physicians who were waiting on me, he
would not undertake my cure. However great attention I showed him and
troubled myself to soothe him, he became more obstinate
(<i>&#7779;ullab</i>), and said: &ldquo;I have no such reliance on my
knowledge that I can undertake the cure.&rdquo; It was the same with
H&#803;ak&#299;m Ab&#363;-l-Q&#257;sim, s. H&#803;ak&#299;mu-l-mulk,
notwithstanding his being a k&#863;h&#257;naz&#257;d, and what was due
for his bringing up; he professed himself suspicious and afraid, and
that considering the matter in his mind, he was terrified and vexed,
and how, then, could he prescribe a remedy? As there was no help for
it, I gave them all up, and weaning my heart from all visible remedies,
gave myself up to the Supreme Physician. As drinking alleviated my
sufferings, I took to it in the daytime, contrary to my habit, and
gradually I carried this to excess. When the weather became hot, the
evil effects of this increased, and my weakness and laboured breathing
were augmented. N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam, whose skill and experience
are greater than those of the physicians, especially as they are
brought to bear through affection and sympathy, endeavoured to diminish
the number of my cups, and to carry out the remedies that appeared
appropriate to the time, and soothing to the condition. Although
previously to this she had approved of the remedies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>made
use of by the physicians, yet at this time I relied on her kindness.
She, by degrees, lessened my wine, and kept me from things that did not
suit me, and food that disagreed with me. I hope that the True
Physician will grant me perfect recovery from the hospital of the
hidden world.</p>
<p class="par">On Monday, the 22nd<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6842src"
href="#xd24e6842" name="xd24e6842src">33</a> of the same month,
corresponding with the 25th of S&#863;haww&#257;l, <span class=
"sc">A.H.</span> 1030 (2 September, 1621), the feast of my solar
weighing took place auspiciously and happily. As in the past year (of
my life) I had suffered from severe illness, I had passed it in
continuous pain and trouble. In thankfulness that such a year ended
well and in safety, and that in the commencement of the present year
the signs of health became apparent, N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam begged
that her Vakils might make the arrangements for the entertainment (of
the solar weighment). In truth, they prepared one which increased the
astonishment of beholders. From the date on which N&#363;r Jah&#257;n
Begam entered into the bond of marriage with this suppliant, although
in all weighing entertainments, both solar and lunar, she had made such
arrangements as were becoming to the State, and knew what were the
requirements of good fortune and prosperity; yet on this occasion she
had paid greater attention than ever to adorn the assembly, and arrange
the feast. All the servants of approved service and the domestics who
knew my temperament, who in that time of weakness had constantly been
present and been ready to sacrifice their lives, and had fluttered
round my head like moths, were now honoured with suitable kindnesses,
such as dresses of honour, jewelled sword-belts, jewelled daggers,
horses, elephants, and trays full of money, each according to their
positions. And though the physicians had not done good service, yet in
consideration of the slight contempt<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6848src" href="#xd24e6848" name="xd24e6848src">34</a> with which
they had been treated for two or three days, they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>received various favours, and on the occasion of
this feast also, they received presents in jewels and cash.</p>
<p class="par">After the conclusion of the weighment, trays of gold and
silver were poured out by way of <i>nis&#804;&#257;r</i>
(coin-scattering) into the hope-skirts of the ministers of amusement
(<i>ahl-i-nis&#863;h&#257;t&#804;</i>), and of the poor. Jotik
R&#257;y, astrologer, who had given the glad news of my recovery and
restoration to health, I had weighed against muhars and rupees, and by
this method a present was made<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6872src"
href="#xd24e6872" name="xd24e6872src">35</a> him of 500 muhars and
7,000 rupees. At the end of the entertainment the offerings she
(N&#363;r Jah&#257;n) had prepared for me were produced. Of the jewels,
jewelled ornaments, cloths and various rarities I selected what I
approved of. Altogether the cost of this great entertainment which
N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam gave was recorded to be two lacs of rupees,
exclusive of what she laid before me as offerings. In previous years,
when I was in health, I weighed 3 maunds and 1 or 2 seers more or less,
but this year, as a result of my weakness and leanness, I was only 2
maunds and 27 seers.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 1st of the Divine month of Mihr,
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K., the Governor of Kashmir, was promoted to the
mansab of 4,000 and 2,500 horse, and R&#257;ja Gaj Singh to that of
4,000 and 3,000 horse. When the news of my illness reached my son,
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, without waiting for a farman he came to
see me, being unable to restrain himself. On the 14th<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e6877src" href="#xd24e6877" name="xd24e6877src">36</a> of the
same month (September 25, 1621), at an auspicious hour and propitious
time, that fortunate son had the good fortune to kiss the threshold,
and went three times round the couch (<i>tak&#863;ht</i>). However much
I adjured him and forbade him to do so, he insisted the more in
lamentation and importunity. I took him by the hand and drew him
towards me, and by way of kindness and affection held him fast in an
embrace, and displayed great love to him. I hope that he may enjoy a
long life with prosperity.</p>
<p class="par">At this time Rs. 20,00,000 were sent to K&#863;hurram
for the expenses of the army of the Deccan by Allah-d&#257;d K., who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>was honoured with an elephant and a standard. On
the 28th Qiy&#257;m K., chief huntsman, died a natural death. He was a
confidential servant, and apart from his skill in hunting, looked over
every trifling detail relating to it, and consulted my pleasure in it.
In short, I was much grieved at this event. I hope that God may grant
him forgiveness.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th the mother of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam
died. Of the amiable qualities of this matron
(<i>Kad-b&#257;n&#363;</i>) of the family of chastity what can I write?
Without exaggeration, in purity of disposition and in wisdom and the
excellencies that are the ornament of women no Mother of the
Age<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6892src" href="#xd24e6892" name=
"xd24e6892src">37</a> was ever born equal to her, and I did not
value<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6896src" href="#xd24e6896" name=
"xd24e6896src">38</a> her less than my own mother. With regard to the
attachment that I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula bore towards her it is
certain that no husband was equal to him. Here one must imagine what
had happened to that grief-stricken old man. Also with regard to the
attachment of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam to her mother what can one
write? A son like &#256;&#7779;af K., exceedingly intelligent and
clever, rent in pieces his robe of patience and left off the dress of
men of the social state (lit., men of dependence, or connection). At
the sight of his dear son, the grief and sorrow of the father, wounded
at heart, increased more and more. However much we admonished him, it
had no result. On the day on which I went to condole with him, as the
disturbance of his mind and grief of his heart had commenced, I spoke a
few words of admonition by way of affection and kindness, but did not
urge him. I left him until (the sense of) his calamity should abate.
After some days I ministered to his inward wound the balm of kindness,
and brought him back to the position of sociable beings. Although in
order to please me and satisfy my mind he outwardly controlled himself,
and made a show of resignation, yet with regard to his affection for
her what resignation could there be? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">On the 1st of the Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n,
Sar-buland K., J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K., and B&#257;q&#299; K., were
honoured with the gift of drums. &#703;Abdu-llah K. had gone to his
jagir without the leave of the Subahdar<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6908src" href="#xd24e6908" name="xd24e6908src">39</a> of the
Deccan: I accordingly told the Chief Diwans to deprive him of his
jagir, and I&#703;tim&#257;d R&#257;y was ordered to act as a
<i>saz&#257;wul</i>, and to send him back to the Deccan.</p>
<p class="par">It has been recorded with regard to the case of
Mas&#299;h&#803;u-z-zam&#257;n (H&#803;ak&#299;m &#7778;adr&#257;)
that, notwithstanding what was due from him for his bringing-up and my
kindness to him, he had not the grace to attend upon me in such an
illness, and more strange still is it that he suddenly threw off the
veil of modesty and asked for leave to undertake a journey to the
Hijaz, and make a pilgrimage to the holy house. Inasmuch as at all
times and under all circumstances the reliance of this suppliant is on
the Lord, that needs no return, and the gracious Creator, I gave him
leave with an open brow. Though he had all kinds of things (for the
journey) I made him a present of Rs. 20,000 in aid of his expenses, and
I hope that the Supreme Physician, without the assistance of physicians
and the means of medicine, may grant this suppliant complete recovery
from the Dispensary of His mercy.</p>
<p class="par">As the air of Agra, in consequence of the increase of
the temperature, did not agree with me, on Monday, the 13th of the
Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n and 16th year (of my reign), the
standards were raised to go towards the hill country of the North, so
that if the air of that quarter should be equable, I might choose some
spot of ground on the bank of the River Ganges, and found a city there,
to make a permanent place of residence for the hot weather, or else
turn the reins of purpose in the direction of Kashmir. Leaving
Muz&#804;affar K. to guard and administer Agra, I dignified him with
drums, a horse, and an elephant. Having appointed his nephew, M.
Muh&#803;ammad faujd&#257;r of the city, I gave him the title of Asad
K., and selected him for increase of mansab. Having exalted B&#257;qir
K. to the duty of the Subah of Oudh, I dismissed him. On the 26th of
the said month my prosperous son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>obtained leave to proceed from Mathura to Bihar
and his jagir. I gave him leave after presenting him with a special
dress of honour, a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i>, a jewelled dagger, a horse,
and an elephant. I hope that he may enjoy long life. On 4
&#256;z&#817;ar, Mukarram K., governor of Delhi, was exalted with the
good fortune of paying his respects. On the 6th I alighted at Delhi,
and having halted two days in Sal&#299;mga&#7771;h I employed myself
with the pleasure of sport. At this time it was reported to me that
J&#257;do R&#257;y Kaitha (or Kathiya), who is one of the leading
Sardars of the Deccan, by the guidance of good fortune and reliance on
God, had elected for loyalty, and had been enrolled amongst the loyal
servants. Bestowing on him a dress of honour and a jewelled dagger, I
sent a gracious farman to him by the hand of Nar&#257;yan D&#257;s
R&#257;thor. On the 1st of the Divine month of Dai, corresponding with
the 7th &#7778;afar, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1031,
Maq&#7779;&#363;d, brother of Q&#257;sim K., was honoured with the
title of H&#257;s&#863;him K. and H&#257;s&#863;him Beg
K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6927src" href=
"#xd24e6927" name="xd24e6927src">40</a> with that of
J&#257;n-nis&#804;&#257;r K.</p>
<p class="par">On the 7th of the same month the camp was pitched at
Hardw&#257;r on the bank of the Ganges. It is one of the most famous
places of worship of the Hindus, and many brahmans and recluses have
chosen a corner of retirement in this place and worship God according
to the rule of their religion. I gave alms in cash and goods to each of
them according to his requirements. As the climate of this skirt of the
hills was not approved by me, and I could not see a spot of ground on
which to make a permanent residence, I proceeded towards the skirt of
the hill country of Jammu and K&#257;ng&#7771;a.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that R&#257;ja
Bh&#257;o Singh had died in the Deccan (become a traveller on the road
of non-existence). From excess of wine-drinking he had become very weak
and low. Suddenly a faintness came over him. However much the
physicians tried remedies for him and burnt scars on the top of his
head, he did not come to his senses: for a night and a day he lay
without perception, and died the next day. Two wives and eight
concubines burnt themselves in the fire of fidelity for him. Jagat
Singh, his elder brother, and Mah&#257; Singh, his nephew, had spent
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>coin of their lives in the wine-business, and
the aforesaid, not taking warning from them, sold sweet life for bitter
fluid. He was of very good disposition and sedate. From the days when I
was a prince he was constantly in my service, and by the blessing of my
education had reached the high rank of 5,000. As he left no son, I
dignified the grandson of his elder brother, though of tender years,
with the title of Raja, and gave him the mansab of 2,000 personal and
1,000 horse. The pargana of Amber, his native place, was assigned to
him as jagir, according to former custom, in order that his family
might not be dispersed. A&#7779;&#257;lat K., s. K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n, was promoted to the mansab of 1,000 personal and 500 horse.
On the 20th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6939src" href="#xd24e6939" name=
"xd24e6939src">41</a> of the same month I halted at the saray of
Alw&#257;t&#363;.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6942src" href="#xd24e6942"
name="xd24e6942src">42</a> As I am constantly engaged in the pleasure
of hunting, and the flesh of animals I have killed with my own hand is
very much to my taste, in consequence of the suspicions and caution
that I have in such matters, I order them to be cleaned in my presence,
and myself inspect their stomachs to see what they have eaten and what
the food of the animals is. If by chance I see anything to which I have
a dislike I forbear from eating the flesh. Before this I was not
inclined towards any kind of waterfowl except the <i>sona</i> (golden
duck?). When I was at Ajmir I saw a tame <i>sona</i> duck eating
horrible worms. From seeing this, my taste turned against it, and I
gave up eating tame <i>sona</i> ducks until now, when a duck was
caught, and I ordered them to clean it in my presence. From its crop
there first came out a small<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6955src" href=
"#xd24e6955" name="xd24e6955src">43</a> fish: after this there appeared
a bug<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6964src" href="#xd24e6964" name=
"xd24e6964src">44</a> so large that I could not believe till I saw it
with my own eye that it could swallow a thing of such a size. Briefly I
this day determined that I would not eat waterfowl. K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam represented that the flesh of the white heron
(<i>&#703;uq&#257;b-i-saf&#299;d</i>) was very delicious and tender. I
accordingly sent for a white heron, and ordered them to clean it in my
presence. By chance there came out of its crop ten <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>bugs
in a manner disgusting to me, at the remembrance of which I am
distressed and disgusted.</p>
<p class="par">On the 21st the garden of Sirhind brought joy to my
senses, and on the day of halt there I delighted myself by going round
and looking at it. At this time K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan came from the Deccan, and had the good fortune
to wait on me. He had great favour shown him. On the 1st of the Divine
month of Bahman I halted at N&#363;r-Sar&#257;y.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6975src" href="#xd24e6975" name="xd24e6975src">45</a> The mansab
of Mu&#703;&rsquo;tamid K., original and increased, was ordered to be
2,000 personal and 600 horse. K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam was made
governor of Allahabad,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6978src" href=
"#xd24e6978" name="xd24e6978src">46</a> and having been presented with
a horse, a dress of honour, and a jewelled sword, took his leave.
Muqarrab K. was selected for the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse. On
Thursday, when I was encamped on the bank of the Biy&#257;h
(Be&#257;s), Q&#257;sim K. came from Lahore, and had the good fortune
to wait on me. H&#257;s&#863;him K., his brother, with the Zamindars of
the country bordering on the hills, had the honour of kissing the
threshold.</p>
<p class="par">B&#257;so&#702;&#299;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6983src" href="#xd24e6983" name="xd24e6983src">47</a> the
zamindar of Talw&#257;ra, brought me a bird, which the hill-people call
<i>j&#257;n-bahan</i>. Its tail resembles the tail of the
<i>qirq&#257;wul</i> (pheasant), which is also called the
<i>tazr&#363;</i>, and its colour is exactly like that of the
hen-pheasant, but it is half as large again. The circle round the eyes
of this bird is red, while the orbit of the pheasant is white. The said
B&#257;so&#702;&#299; stated that this bird lived in the
snow-mountains, and that its food was grass and other stuff. I have
kept pheasants and have reared young ones, and have often eaten the
flesh both of young birds and of mature ones. One may say that there is
no comparison between the flesh of the pheasant and this bird. The
flesh of the latter is much more delicate. Among the birds which I saw
in the hill-country one was the <i>ph&#363;l-paik&#257;r</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6999src" href="#xd24e6999" name=
"xd24e6999src">48</a> which the Kashmiris call <i>sonl&#363;</i>. It is
one-eighth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>(<i>n&#299;m saw&#257;&#702;&#299;</i>?) less
than a pea-hen. The back, tail, and wings resemble those of the
bustard, and are blackish, with white spots. The breast to the end of
the bosom is black, with white spots, and some red ones. The ends of
the feathers are fiery red, and very lustrous and beautiful. From the
end of the back of the neck it is also brilliantly black. On the top of
its head it has two fleshy horns of a turquoise colour. The skin of its
orbits and round its mouth is red. Below its throat there is skin round
it enough to cover the palms of two hands, and in the middle of this
the skin is of a violet colour of the size of a hand, with blue spots
in the middle. Around it each streak is of a blue colour, consisting of
eight plumes; round the blue streak it is red to the breadth of two
fingers, like the peach flower, and again round its neck is that
blue-coloured streak: it has red legs also. The live bird, which was
weighed, came to 152 tolahs. After it was killed and cleaned it weighed
139 tolahs. Another bird is of a golden colour: this the people of
Lahore call <i>S&#863;han</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e7015src" href=
"#xd24e7015" name="xd24e7015src">49</a> (?) and the Kashmiris
<i>p&#363;t&#804;</i>. Its colour is like that of a peacock&rsquo;s
breast. Above its head is a tuft (<i>k&#257;kul</i>). Its tail of the
width of five fingers is yellow, and is like the long feather
(<i>s&#863;hah-par</i>) of the peacock, and its body as large as that
of a goose. The neck of the goose is long and shapeless: that of this
one is short, and has a shape.</p>
<p class="par">My brother, S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, had asked
for golden birds,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7039src" href="#xd24e7039"
name="xd24e7039src">50</a> and I sent some to him by his ambassador. On
Monday<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7044src" href="#xd24e7044" name=
"xd24e7044src">51</a> the ceremony of my lunar weighing took place. At
this entertainment N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam gave dresses of honour to
forty-five of the great Amirs and private servants. On the 14th of the
same month the camp was pitched at the village of Bahlwan<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7047src" href="#xd24e7047" name=
"xd24e7047src">52</a> belonging to the S&#299;b&#257; district. As I
constantly longed for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href=
"#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>air of K&#257;ng&#7771;a and the
hill-country above-mentioned, I left the large camp at this place, and
proceeded to inspect the said fort with some of my special servants and
attendants. As I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula was ill I left him in the
camp, and kept &#7778;&#257;diq K., the chief Bakhshi, there to look
after him and guard the camp. The next day news came that his state had
undergone a change, and that the signs of hopelessness were apparent. I
could not bear the agitation of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam, and,
considering the affection which I bore towards him, I returned to the
camp. At the end of the day I went to see him. It was the hour of his
death agony. Sometimes he became unconscious and sometimes came back to
his senses. N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam indicated me, and said: &ldquo;Do
you recognise (him)?&rdquo; At such a time he recited this couplet of
Anwar&#299;:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Were a mother-born blind man present</p>
<p class="line">He&rsquo;d recognise Majesty in the World-Adorner.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">I was for two hours at his pillow. Whenever he was
conscious, whatever he said was intelligent and rational. In fine, on
the 17th of the said month (Bahman) (about the end of January, 1622),
after three gharis had passed he attained to eternal mercy. What shall
I say about my feelings through this terrible event? He was a wise and
perfect Vizier, and a learned and affectionate companion.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4><span class="sc">Verse.</span><a class="noteref" id="xd24e7066src"

<p class="line">By the reckoning of the eye, there&rsquo;s one frame

<p class="line">By Wisdom&rsquo;s reckoning, the lessening is more than

</div>
<p class="par first">Though the weight of such a kingdom was on his
shoulders, and it is not possible for or within the power of a mortal
to make everyone contented, yet no one ever went to
I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula with a petition or on business who turned
from him in an injured frame of mind. He showed loyalty to the
sovereign, and yet left pleased and hopeful him who was in need. In
fact, this was a speciality of his. From the day on which his companion
(his wife) attained to the mercy of God he cared no longer for himself,
but melted away from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223"
name="pb223">223</a>]</span>day to day. Although outwardly he looked
after the affairs of the kingdom, and taking pains with the ordering of
civil matters, did not withdraw his hand from business, yet in his
heart he grieved at the separation, and at last, after three months and
twenty days, he passed away. The next day I went to condole with his
sons and sons-in-law, and, presenting 41 of his children and
connections and 12 of his dependents with dresses of honour, I took
them out of their mourning garments.</p>
<p class="par">The next day I marched with the same purpose (as
before), and went to see the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a. In four stages
the camp was pitched at the river B&#257;nganga. Alf K. and
S&#863;haik&#863;h Faiz&#803;u-llah, the guards of the fort, had the
good fortune to pay their respects. At this stage the offering of the
Raja of Chamba<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7081src" href="#xd24e7081"
name="xd24e7081src">54</a> was laid before me. His country is 25 koss
beyond K&#257;ng&#7771;a. There is no greater Zamindari in these hills
than this. The country is the asylum of all the Zamindars of the
country. It has passes (<i>&#703;aqabah&#257;</i>) difficult to cross.
Until now he had not obeyed any king nor sent offerings. His brother
also was honoured by paying his respects, and on his part performed the
dues of service and loyalty. He seemed to me to be reasonable and
intelligent and urbane. I exalted him with all kinds of patronage and
favour.</p>
<p class="par">On the 24th<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7090src" href=

Q&#257;z&#803;&#299;, the Chief Justice (<i>M&#299;r &#703;Adl</i>),
and other learned men of Islam should accompany me and carry out in the
fort whatever was customary, according to the religion of
Muh&#803;ammad. Briefly, having traversed about one koss, I went up to
the top of the fort, and by the grace of God, the call to prayer and
the reading of the <i>K&#863;hut&#804;ba</i> and the slaughter of a
bullock, which had not taken place from the commencement of the
building of the fort till now, were carried out in my presence. I
prostrated myself in thanksgiving for this great gift, which no king
had hoped to receive, and ordered a lofty mosque to be built inside the
fort. The fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a is situated on a high hill, and is
so strong that if furnished with provisions and the necessaries for a
fort <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>the hand of force cannot reach its skirt, and
the noose of stratagem must fall short of it. Although there are
heights (<i>sar-k&#363;bh&#257;</i>) in some places, and guns and
muskets might reach (the fort) from them, yet no harm would accrue to
the garrison, for they could move to another part of the fort,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7105src" href="#xd24e7105" name=
"xd24e7105src">56</a> and be safe. It has 23 bastions and seven gates.
Its inner circumference is 1 koss and 15 ropes, its length is &frac14;
koss and 2 ropes (<i>t&#804;an&#257;b</i>), its breadth not more than
22 ropes nor less than 15. Its height is 114 cubits. There are two
reservoirs inside the fort, one 2 ropes long and 1&frac12; broad; the
other is of the same length (?).<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7111src"
href="#xd24e7111" name="xd24e7111src">57</a></p>
<p class="par">After going round the fort I went to see the temple of
Durg&#257;, which is known as Bhawan.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7116src" href="#xd24e7116" name="xd24e7116src">58</a> A world has
here wandered in the desert of error. Setting aside the infidels whose
custom is the worship of idols, crowds on crowds of the people of
Islam, traversing long distances, bring their offerings and pray to the
black stone (image). Near the temple, and on the slope of the hill
there is a sulphur-mine (<i>k&#257;n</i>), and its heat causes flames
to continually burst forth. They call it Jw&#257;l&#257;
Mukh&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7122src" href="#xd24e7122" name=
"xd24e7122src">59</a> (Flame-Face or Burning Mouth), and regard it as
one of the idol&rsquo;s miracles. In fact, Hindus, while knowing the
truth,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7134src" href="#xd24e7134" name=
"xd24e7134src">60</a> deceive the common people. Hindus say<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7139src" href="#xd24e7139" name=
"xd24e7139src">61</a> that when the life of Mah&#257;deo&rsquo;s wife
came to an end and she drank the draught of death, Mah&#257;deo, in his
great love and attachment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>to her, took her dead body on his
back, and went about the world carrying her corpse. When some time had
passed in this manner, her form dissolved and dropped asunder, and each
limb fell in a different place: they give honour and dignity to the
place according to the dignity and grace of the member. As the breast,
which when compared with other members has the greatest dignity, fell
in this place, they hold it more precious than any other. Some maintain
that this stone, which is now a place of worship for the vile infidels,
is not the stone which was there originally, but that a body of the
people<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7145src" href="#xd24e7145" name=
"xd24e7145src">62</a> of Islam came and carried off the original stone,
and threw it into the bottom of the river, with the intent that no one
could get at it. For a long time the tumult of the infidels and
idol-worshippers had died away in the world, till a lying brahman hid a
stone for his own ends, and going to the Raja of the time said:
&ldquo;I saw Durg&#257; in a dream, and she said to me: &lsquo;They
have thrown me into a certain place: quickly go and take me
up.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Raja, in the simplicity of his heart, and greedy
for the offerings of gold that would come to him, accepted the tale of
the brahman, and sent a number of people with him, and brought that
stone, and kept it in this place with honour, and started again the
shop of error and misleading. But God only knows!</p>
<p class="par">From the temple I went to see the valley which is known
as K&#363;h-i-Mad&#257;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7150src" href=
"#xd24e7150" name="xd24e7150src">63</a> It is a delightful place. From
its climate, the freshness of its verdure, and its delightful position
it is a place of pleasure worthy to be seen. There is a waterfall here
which pours down water from the top of the hill. I ordered them to put
up a symmetrical building there. On the 25th <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>of
the month the standards were turned back to return. Having presented
Alf K. and S&#863;haik&#863;h Faiz&#803;u-llah with horses and
elephants I left them to defend the fort. Next day I encamped at the
fort of N&#363;rp&#363;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7158src" href=
"#xd24e7158" name="xd24e7158src">64</a> It was reported to me that in
this neighbourhood there were many jungle fowl. As I had never yet
caught these, I made a halt of another day, and enjoyed myself with the
sport, having caught four. One cannot distinguish them in shape and
colour from domestic fowls. One of the peculiarities of these birds is
that if they are caught by the feet and turned upside down, wherever
they are taken they make no sound, and remain silent, contrary to the
domestic fowl, which makes an outcry. Until the domestic fowl is
plunged into hot water its feathers do not come off easily. The jungle
fowl, like the partridge and <i>podna</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7164src" href="#xd24e7164" name="xd24e7164src">65</a> can be
plucked when dry. I ordered them to roast them. It was found that the
flesh of the full-grown ones was very tasteless and dry. The chickens
had some juiciness, but were not good to eat. They cannot fly farther
than a bow-shot. The cock<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7173src" href=
"#xd24e7173" name="xd24e7173src">66</a> is chiefly red, and the hen
black and yellow. There are many in this N&#363;rp&#363;r jungle. The
ancient name of N&#363;rp&#363;r is Dhamer&#299;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7182src" href="#xd24e7182" name="xd24e7182src">67</a> Since
R&#257;ja B&#257;so built the fort and made houses and gardens they
call it N&#363;rp&#363;r, after my name. About Rs. 30,000 were expended
on the building. Certes, the buildings Hindus construct after their
fashion, however much they decorate them, are not pleasant. As the
place was fit and the locality enchanting, I ordered them to spend Rs.
1,00,000 out of the public treasury, and to erect buildings at it, and
to make lofty edifices suited to the spot.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that there was a
<i>Sanny&#257;s&#299; Mot&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e7189src"
href="#xd24e7189" name="xd24e7189src">68</a> in the neighbourhood who
had entirely renounced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href=
"#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>control over himself. I ordered
them to bring him that I might ascertain the real state of affairs.
They call Hindu devotees <i>Sarb b&#257;s&#299;</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7213src" href="#xd24e7213" name="xd24e7213src">69</a> By usage
the word has become <i>San-ny&#257;s&#299;</i> (laying down
everything). There are many degrees among them, and there are several
orders among the Sarb b&#257;s&#299;. Among them there is the
<i>Mot&#299;</i> order. They put themselves into the figure of a cross
(?) (<i>&#7779;alb ik&#863;htiy&#257;r m&#299;kunand</i>) and surrender
themselves (<i>tasl&#299;m</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e7236src"
href="#xd24e7236" name="xd24e7236src">70</a>
<i>m&#299;s&#257;zand</i>). For instance, they never speak. If for ten
days and nights they stand in one place, they do not move their feet
forwards or backwards; in fact, make no movement at all, and remain
like fossils. When he came into my presence I examined him, and found a
wonderful state of persistence. It occurred to me that in a state of
drunkenness and absence of mind and delirium, some change might be
wrought in him. Accordingly I ordered them to give him some cups of
spirit (<i>&#703;araq</i>) of double strength. This was done in royal
fashion (liberally?), but not the least change took place, and he
remained in the same impassive state. At last his senses left him, and
they carried him out like a corpse. God Almighty granted him mercy so
that he did not lose his life. Certainly there was great persistence in
his nature.</p>
<p class="par">At this time B&#299;-badal K. presented me with the
chronogram of the conquest of K&#257;ng&#7771;a, and that of the

K&#863;husrau died in the Deccan, and presumably at Burhanpur or

of the month of Jum&#257;da-l-awwal, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1031,
March 10&ndash;12, 1622, after one watch, five gharis and a fraction
had passed, the sun that illuminates the world lighted the mansion of
Aries, and the 17th year of the reign of this suppliant began
auspiciously and happily. On this joy-increasing day &#256;&#7779;af K.
was promoted to the mansab of 6,000 personal and horse. Having given
Q&#257;sim K. leave to proceed to the government of the Panjab, I
presented him with a horse, an elephant, and a dress of honour. Eighty
thousand darbs were given to Zambil Beg, ambassador of the ruler of
Persia. On the 6th of the same month (Farward&#299;n) the royal camp
was at R&#257;walpind&#299;. F&#257;z&#803;il K. was promoted to the
post of Bakhshi. Zamb&#299;l Beg was ordered to remain at ease in
Lahore until the return of the victorious army from Kashmir. An
elephant was conferred on Akbarqul&#299; K. Gakkar.</p>
<p class="par">At this time I frequently heard that the ruler of Persia
had hastened from Khurasan for the purpose of conquering Qandahar.
Although looking to our previous and present connections, it appeared
very unlikely, and beyond all calculation, that such a great king
should entertain such light and crude ideas, and himself come against
one of my humble slaves who was in Qandahar with 300 or 400<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7344src" href="#xd24e7344" name="xd24e7344src">2</a>
servants, yet as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231"
name="pb231">231</a>]</span>caution is one of the duties of a ruler and
becoming to a king, I sent Zainu-l-&#703;&#256;bid&#299;n, Bakhshi of
<i>Ah&#803;ad&#299;s</i>, with a gracious farman to K&#863;hurram to
come and wait on me with all possible speed with a victorious host, and
elephants of mountain hugeness, and the numerous artillery that were
assigned for his support in that Subah. So that, if these words should
be near the truth, he might come and be despatched with an innumerable
army and countless treasure, in order that he (the king of Persia)
might discover the result of breaking faith and of wrong-doing.</p>
<p class="par">On the 8th I halted at the fountain of H&#803;asan
Abd&#257;l. Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. was promoted to the mansab of
2,000 personal and 1,000 horse, and Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n was
appointed Bakhshi of the Ah&#803;ad&#299;s. On Friday, the 12th,
Mah&#257;bat K., having come from Kabul, waited on me and had the good
fortune to pay his respects, and became the recipient of
daily-increasing favours. He presented 100 muhrs as a present and Rs.
10,000 as alms. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan passed his
followers before me in review; 2,500 well-horsed cavalry were enrolled
of whom 400 were matchlock men. At this stage a <i>qamurg&#863;ha</i>
hunt was arranged, and I shot<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7357src" href=
"#xd24e7357" name="xd24e7357src">3</a> 33 hill <i>q&#363;chq&#257;r</i>
(mountain sheep), etc. At this time H&#803;ak&#299;m M&#363;min&#257;,
at the recommendation of the pillar of the State, Mah&#257;bat K., had
the good fortune to wait on me. With power and courage he undertook my
cure, and I hope that his coming may prove auspicious to me. The mansab
of Am&#257;nu-llah, s. Mah&#257;bat K., was fixed at 2,000 personal and
1,800 horse. On the 19th I encamped near Pakhl&#299;, and the feast of
the culmination was held there. Having given Mah&#257;bat K. leave to
return to Kabul, I gave him a horse, an elephant, and a dress of
honour. The mansab of I&#703;tib&#257;r K. was ordered to be 5,000
personal and 4,000 horse. As he was an old servant, and had become very
weak and old, I promoted him to the Subah of Agra, and entrusted to him
the defence of the fort and the treasury, and, presenting him with an
elephant, a horse, and a dress of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232"
href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>honour, dismissed him. At the
Pass of Kunwar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7368src" href="#xd24e7368"
name="xd24e7368src">4</a> Mast, Ir&#257;dat K. came from Kashmir, and
had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. On the 2nd of the Divine
month of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht, I entered the enchanting region of
Kashmir. M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n was promoted to the mansab of 2,500
personal and 1,400 horse. At this time, in order to ease the condition
of the ryots and soldiery, I did away with the faujd&#257;ri cess, and
gave an order that in the whole of my dominions they should not impose
anything on account of faujd&#257;ri. Zabar-dast K., Master of the
Ceremonies (M&#299;r T&#363;zuk), was promoted to the mansab of 2,000
personal and 700 horse. On the 13th, by the advice of the physicians,
and especially of H&#803;ak&#299;m M&#363;min&#257;, I was lightened by
being bled from my left leg. A present of a dress of honour was made to
Muqarrab K., and one of 1,000 darbs to H&#803;ak&#299;m
M&#363;min&#257;. At the request of K&#863;hurram the mansab of
&#703;Abdu-llah K. was fixed at 6,000. Sar-far&#257;z<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7372src" href="#xd24e7372" name="xd24e7372src">5</a> K. was
honoured with the gift of drums. Bah&#257;dur K. Uzbeg, having come
from Qandahar, had the good fortune to pay his respects: by way of
nazar he gave 100 muhrs, and by way of charity offered Rs. 4,000.
Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; K., governor of Thatta, had sent as an
offering a S&#863;h&#257;h-n&#257;ma and a K&#863;hamsa (quintet) of
S&#863;haik&#863;h Niz&#804;&#257;m&#299; illustrated by masters (of
painting), along with other presents: these were laid before me. On the
1st of the Divine month of K&#863;hurd&#257;d Las&#863;hkar K. was
exalted to the mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and to
M&#299;r Jumla was given that of 2,500 personal and 1,000 horse. Some
of the Amirs of the Deccan were similarly honoured with an increase of
mansab. Promotion was also given as follows: Sard&#257;r K., 3,000 and
2,500 horse; Sar-buland K., 2,500 personal and 2,200 horse;
B&#257;q&#299; K., 2,500 and 2,000 horse; S&#863;harza K., 2,500 and
1,200 horse; J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K., 2,000 personal and 2,000 horse;
M&#299;rz&#257; W&#257;l&#299;, 2,500 and 1,000 horse; M&#299;rz&#257;
Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n s. M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, 1,500 personal and horse; Z&#257;hid K.,
1,500 and 700 horse; &#703;Aq&#299;dat K., 1,200 and 300 <span class=

K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;, 1,200 and 600 horse; and
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r K., 1,000 personal and 500 horse. R&#257;ja
Gaj Singh and Himmat K. were selected for drums. On the 2nd of the
Divine month of T&#299;r, Sayyid B&#257;yaz&#299;d was honoured with
the title of Mu&#7779;t&#804;af&#257; K., and was also presented with
drums. At this time Tahawwur K., who is one of the personal servants,
was despatched with a gracious farman to summon my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z.</p>
<p class="par">Some days before this, petitions came from the officials
in Qandahar reporting the intention of the ruler of Persia to conquer
Qandahar, but my mind, which is actuated by sincerity, looking to past
and present relations, placed no reliance on the truth of this until
the report of my son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n arrived that
S&#863;h&#257;h &#703;Abb&#257;s, with the armies of Iraq and Khurasan,
had come and besieged Qandahar. I ordered them to fix an hour for
leaving Kashmir. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, the Diwan,
and Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; &#7778;&#257;diq K. hastened to Lahore in
advance of the victorious army to expedite the arrival of the princes
of high degree with the armies of the Deccan, Gujarat, Bengal, and
Behar, and to send on the Amirs who were present with the victorious
stirrups, and those who one after another should come in from the
districts of their jagirs to my son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n at
Multan. At the same time the artillery, with the strings of warlike
elephants, and the armoury<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7379src" href=
"#xd24e7379" name="xd24e7379src">6</a> were to be prepared and
forwarded. As there was little cultivation between Multan and Qandahar,
the despatch of a large army without provisions was not to be thought
of. It was therefore decided to encourage the grain-sellers, who in the
language of India are called <i>banj&#257;r&#257;</i>, and, providing
them with money, to take them along with the victorious army, so that
there might be no difficulty about supplies. The
Banj&#257;r&#257;s<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7385src" href=
"#xd24e7385" name="xd24e7385src">7</a> are a tribe. Some of them have
1,000 bullocks, and some more or less. They take grain from different
districts (<i>bul&#363;k&#257;t</i>) into the towns and sell it. They
go along with the armies, and with such an army there would be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>100,000 bullocks or more. It is hoped that by
the grace of the Creator, the army will be furnished with numbers and
arms so that there may be no delay or hesitation until it <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e7397" title="Source: reach">reaches</span>
Isf&#257;han, which is his (the Shah&rsquo;s) capital. A farman was
sent to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n to beware and not start in that
direction (Qandahar) from Multan before the arrival of the victorious
army, and not be disturbed, but attend to orders. Bah&#257;dur K. Uzbeg
was selected to go as an auxiliary to the army of Qandahar, and
favoured with a horse and dress of honour. F&#257;z&#803;il K. was
given the mansab of 2,000 personal and 750 horse.</p>
<p class="par">As it had been brought to notice that the poor of
Kashmir suffer hardships in the winter from the excessive cold, and
live with difficulty, I ordered that a village of the rental of Rs.
3,000 or Rs. 4,000 should be entrusted to Mull&#257; T&#804;&#257;lib
I&#7779;fah&#257;n&#299;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7402src" href=
"#xd24e7402" name="xd24e7402src">8</a> to be expended in providing
clothes for the poor, and for warming water, for purposes of ablution,
in the mosques.</p>
<p class="par">As it was reported that the Zamindars of
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r had again raised their heads in disobedience and
sin, and engaged in sedition and disturbance, Ir&#257;dat K. was
ordered to proceed hot-foot, before they had time to establish
themselves firmly, and having inflicted condign punishment on them to
tear up the root of sedition. On this day
Zainu-l-&#703;&#256;bid&#299;n, who had been sent to summon
K&#863;hurram, came and waited on me, and reported that the stipulation
he made was that he should pass the rainy season in the fort of
M&#257;nd&#363;, and then come to Court. His report was read.
I<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7407src" href="#xd24e7407" name=
"xd24e7407src">9</a> did not like the style of its purport nor the
request he made, and, on the contrary, the traces of disloyalty
(<i>b&#299;-daulat&#299;</i>) were apparent. There being no remedy, an
order was given that as he proposed to come after the rains, he should
despatch the great Amirs, the servants of the Court who were employed
in assisting him, and especially the Sayyids of B&#257;rha and Bukhara,
the S&#863;haik&#863;h-z&#257;das, the Afghans, and the Rajputs.
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam and I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. were ordered to go to
Lahore in advance, and assist the army <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>of Qandahar. Rs.
l,00,000 were given them as advance of pay, and I also granted drums to
&#703;In&#257;yat K. and I&#703;tim&#257;d K. Ir&#257;dat K., who had
hastened to punish the rebels of Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, having killed
many of them and regained the mastery and established himself firmly,
returned to duty. Mu&#703;tamid K. had been appointed
Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; to the army of the Deccan. As that matter was
over<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7415src" href="#xd24e7415" name=
"xd24e7415src">10</a> he was sent for at his own request. He came on
this day, and on his arrival kissed the threshold.</p>
<p class="par">It is a strange thing that when a pearl of the value of
Rs. 14,000 or 15,000 was lost in the harem, Jotik R&#257;y, the
astrologer, represented that it would be found in two or three days.
&#7778;&#257;diq K. Ramm&#257;l (soothsayer) represented that in the
same two or three days it would come from a place which was perfectly
clean and pure, such as the place of worship or oratory. A female
soothsayer represented that it would soon be found, and that a woman
with white skin would bring it in a state of ecstasy, and give it into
the hand of the H&#803;az&#803;rat (the king). It happened that on the
third day one of the Turkish girls found it in the oratory, and all in
smiles and in a happy frame of mind gave it to me. As the words of all
three came true each one was favoured with an acceptable reward. This
is written because it is not devoid of strangeness.</p>
<p class="par">At this time I appointed Kaukab and
K&#863;hidmatg&#257;r K., and others to the number of twelve in all, of
the familiar servants to be <i>saz&#257;wuls</i> of the Amirs in the
Deccan in order that they might exert themselves and send them forward
as soon as possible to Court, so that they (the Am&#299;rs) might be
sent to the victorious army at Qandahar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7425src" href="#xd24e7425" name="xd24e7425src">11</a> At this
time it was frequently reported to me that K&#863;hurram had taken into
his possession some of the estates of the jagir of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n
Begam and S&#863;hahriy&#257;r, and especially the pargana of Dholpur,
which had by the High Diwan been assigned to S&#863;hahriy&#257;r,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>and had sent there an Afghan of the name of
Dary&#257;, one of his own servants, with a body of men. Dary&#257;
fought with S&#863;har&#299;fu-l-mulk, a servant of
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r, who had been appointed to the faujd&#257;ri of
that region, and many were killed on both sides. Although in
consequence of his (K&#863;hurram&rsquo;s) remaining in the fort of
M&#257;nd&#363;, and the unreasonable requests made in his letter it
appeared that his reason was turned, yet from hearing this news it
became clear that he was unworthy of all the favours and cherishing I
had bestowed on him, and that his brain had gone wrong. Accordingly I
sent R&#257;ja R&#363;z-afz&#363;n, who was a confidential servant, to
him, and made inquiries as to the cause of this boldness. He was
ordered hereafter to behave properly, and not place his foot beyond the
path of reasonableness and the high road of politeness, and content
himself with the districts of his own jagir that he had obtained from
the High Diwan. He must also beware not to form any intention of coming
to wait upon me, but to send the body of the servants of the State I
had requisitioned on account of the disturbance at Qandahar to the
Court. If anything contrary to this order should come to notice, he
would repent it.</p>
<p class="par">At this time M&#299;r Z&#804;ah&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n, the
grandson of M&#299;r M&#299;r&#257;n, s. the famous S&#863;h&#257;h
Ni&#703;matu-llah, came from Persia and waited on me, and received as a
present a dress of honour and 8,000 darbs. Uj&#257;l&#257; Dakhan&#299;
obtained leave to go to R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo with a gracious
farman in order that he should act as <i>saz&#257;wul</i> and collect
the men. Previously to this, on account of the great regard and
abundant affection I bore to K&#863;hurram and his sons, at the time
when his son (S&#863;huj&#257;&#703;) was very ill, I had determined
that if God Almighty would grant him to me I would not again sport with
a gun, and would inflict no injury on a living thing with my own hand.
Notwithstanding my inclination and love for hunting, especially with a
gun, I had given it up for five years. At this time, when I was greatly
distressed at his unkind behaviour, I took again to sporting with a
gun, and gave orders that nobody should remain in the palace without
one. In a short time most of the servants took a liking to shooting
with guns, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237"
name="pb237">237</a>]</span>archers,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7437src" href="#xd24e7437" name="xd24e7437src">12</a> in order to
perform their duties, became cavalry soldiers.</p>
<p class="par">On the 25th of the month, corresponding with the 7th
S&#863;haww&#257;l, at the favourable hour that had been chosen, I
turned towards Lahore from Kashmir (apparently means Srinagar, the
capital). I sent Bih&#257;r&#299; D&#257;s Brahman with a gracious
farman to R&#257;n&#257; Karan to the effect that he should bring his
son with a body of men to pay his respects to me. M&#299;r
Z&#804;ah&#299;ru-d-d&#299;n was promoted to the mansab of 1,000
personal and 400 horse. As he represented to me that he was in debt, I
made him a present of Rs. 10,000. On the 1st of S&#863;hahr&#299;war I
encamped at the fountain of Achbal,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7450src"
href="#xd24e7450" name="xd24e7450src">13</a> and on Thursday I had a
feast of cups beside the fountain.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7453src"
href="#xd24e7453" name="xd24e7453src">14</a> On this auspicious day my
fortunate son S&#863;hahriy&#257;r was appointed to the Qandahar
expedition, and was promoted to the mansab of 12,000 personal and 8,000
horse. A special dress of honour, with a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> with
pearl buttons, was also given him. At this time a merchant had brought
two large pearls from the country of Turkey, one of them weighing
1&frac14; <i>mis&#804;q&#257;ls</i>, and the second 1
<i>surk&#863;h</i> less. N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam bought the two for
Rs. 60,000, and presented them to me as an offering on the same day. On
Friday, the 10th, by the advice of H&#803;ak&#299;m
M&#363;min&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7466src" href="#xd24e7466"
name="xd24e7466src">15</a> I was relieved by bleeding from the arm.
Muqarrab K., who has great skill in this art, always used to bleed me,
and possibly never failed before, but now failed twice. Afterwards
Q&#257;sim, his nephew, bled me. I gave him a dress of honour and Rs.
2,000, and gave 1,000 darbs to H&#803;ak&#299;m M&#363;min&#257;.
M&#299;r K&#863;h&#257;n, at the request of K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n,
was promoted to the mansab of 1,500 and 900 horse. <span class=

<p class="par">On the 21st of the month the feast of my solar weighing

went to see the waterfall of Ashar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7473src"

valley of L&#257;r. The water of Ashar was 3 <i>m&#257;s&#863;ha</i>
heavier than that of the Ganges, and the latter was &frac12;
<i>m&#257;s&#863;ha</i> lighter than that of the valley of L&#257;r. On
the 30th the camp was at H&#299;r&#257;p&#363;r. Though Ir&#257;dat K.
had done his duty in Kis&#863;htw&#257;r well, yet as the ryots and
inhabitants of Kashmir complained of his treatment of them, I promoted
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K. to the governorship of Kashmir. I bestowed on him
a horse, a dress of honour, and a special enemy-piercing<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7488src" href="#xd24e7488" name=
"xd24e7488src">18</a> sword, and appointed Ir&#257;dat K. to do duty
with the army of Qandahar. Having brought Kunwar Singh, the Raja of
Kis&#863;htw&#257;r, out of the fortress of Gwalior, where he was
imprisoned, I bestowed Kis&#863;htw&#257;r on him, and gave him a horse
and a dress of honour, with the title of Raja. I sent H&#803;aidar
Malik to Kashmir (<i>i.e.</i>, Srinagar) to bring a canal from the
valley of L&#257;r to the N&#363;r-afz&#257; garden, giving him Rs.
30,000 for the materials and labour. On the 12th of the month I came
down from the hill country of Jamm&#363;, and pitched at Bhimbhar. The
next day I had a <i>qamurqha</i> hunt. To
D&#257;war-bak&#863;hs&#863;h, s. K&#863;husrau, I gave the mansab of
5,000 personal and 2,000 horse. On the 24th I crossed the

had sent him with the idea that perhaps he might carry his point by
flattery and smooth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239"

I<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7509src" href="#xd24e7509" name=

Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, who had hastened to Lahore to make provision
for the army of Qandahar, had the good fortune to kiss the threshold.
On the 1st of the Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n, Am&#257;nu-llah, s.
Mah&#257;bat K., was promoted to the mansab of 3,000 personal and 1,700
horse. A gracious farman was sent to summon Mah&#257;bat K. At this
time &#703;Abdu-llah K., whom I had sent for for service at Qandahar,
having come from the district of his jagir, paid his respects. On the
4th of the same month I entered the city of Lahore auspiciously and
happily. Alf K. was promoted to the mansab of 2,000 and 1,500 horse. I
gave<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7513src" href="#xd24e7513" name=
"xd24e7513src">22</a> an order to the chief Diwans to levy the pay of
the force of servants of the State who had been appointed for service
at Qandahar out of the jagirs of K&#863;hurram, which were in the
Sarkar of H&#803;i&#7779;&#257;r, and in the D&#363;-&#257;b and those
regions. In the place of these he might take possession of districts
from the Subah of Malwa and the Deccan, and Gujarat and Khandesh,
wherever he wished. Presenting Afz&#803;al K. with a dress of honour I
gave him leave to go. An order was passed that the Subahs of Gujarat,
Malwa, the Deccan and Khandesh should be handed over to him
(K&#863;hurram), and he might take up a permanent residence wherever he
might wish, and employ himself in the administration of those regions.
He was to send quickly the saz&#257;wuls who had been appointed to
bring the servants of the State who had been summoned to my presence on
account of the disturbance at Qandahar. After that he was to look after
his own charge, and not depart from order: otherwise, he would repent.
On this day I gave the best <i>tipch&#257;q</i> horse that was in my
private stable to &#703;Abdu-llah K. On the 26th H&#803;aidar Beg and
Wal&#299; Beg, envoys of the ruler of Persia, had an audience. After
performing the ceremony of salutation they produced a letter from the
Shah. My son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

1,000 muhrs, 1,000 rupees, and 18 horses. Mah&#257;bat K. was promoted
to the mansab of 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse. I gave an elephant to
M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam. R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo was appointed

belonged to our saintly family passed out of possession, but when this
suppliant at the throne of Grace became sovereign, he, by God&rsquo;s
help, and the excellent measures of friends, recovered the hereditary
lands which were in the possession of enemies. As Qandahar was held by
the agents of your lofty family, I regarded you as myself, and did not
make any objection. From feelings of unity and brotherhood we waited,
thinking that you would, after the manner of your ancestors<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7538src" href="#xd24e7538" name=
"xd24e7538src">24</a> who are in Paradise, voluntarily take the matter
into your consideration. When you neglected to do this, I repeatedly,
by writing and verbal messages, directly and indirectly, asked for the
disposal of the question, thinking that perhaps that petty country
(Qandahar) was not regarded as worthy of your notice. You said several
times that by making over the territory to our family, the notions of
enemies and censurers would be disposed of, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>praters, enviers, and fault-finders would be put

"#xd24e7543" name="xd24e7543src">25</a> formerly delayed the settlement
of this matter. As the truth of the affair was known to friends and
enemies, and as no clear answer, either of refusal or concession, came
from you, it occurred to me that I would go to Qandahar to see it, and
to hunt. In this way the agents of my distinguished brother, in
accordance with the ties of friendship which exist between us, might
welcome us and wait upon us. By this means the relationship of union
would be renewed, and would be made evident to the world, and the
tongues of the envious and the evil-speaking be shortened. With this
view, I set off without apparatus for taking forts, and when I came to
Far&#257;h I sent a rescript to the governor of Qandahar, mentioning
that I intended to see the place and hunt there. I did this in order
that he might treat me as a guest. We also called the honourable
K&#863;hw&#257;ja B&#257;q&#299; Kurkar&#257;q, and sent a message to
the governor and the other officers in the fort to the effect that
there was no difference between Your Majesty and ourselves, and that we
were aware of each other&rsquo;s territories, and that we were coming
to see the country. Therefore they were not to act in such a way as to
give umbrage or to vex anyone. They did not receive the conciliatory
order and message in the proper way, but showed obstinacy and a
rebellious spirit. When I came to the fort I again called the
honourable aforesaid (K. B&#257;q&#299;), and sent him with the message
that I had directed my troops not to invest the fort till the lapse of
ten days. They did not receive the wholesome advice, and were stubborn
in their opposition. As there was nothing more to be done, the Persian
army set about taking the fort, though it was in want of appliances,
and soon levelled the walls and bastions with the ground. The garrison
became straitened, and asked for quarter. We, too, maintained the ties
of love which had existed from of old between the two exalted
dynasties, and the brotherly relation which was formed between you and
me when you were prince (M&#299;rz&#257;), and which was an object of
envy to contemporary sovereigns, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"

Q&#363;rb&#257;s&#863;h&#299;, who is one of the sincere
&#7778;&#363;f&#299;s of this family. Of a truth, the foundation of
love and union, both inherited and acquired, on the part of this seeker
after affection, has not grown old or decayed, and is strong so that no

harmony and unity which existed between us and the exalted family (of

require that they make oaths of friendship to one another, and that
there should be perfect spiritual agreement between them. There should
be no need of physical contact, and still less should there be any
necessity for visiting one another&rsquo;s countries for
&lsquo;shooting and spectacle&rsquo; (<i>sair u

<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">Alas, a hundred times for the love passing thought!</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;By the arrival of your loving letter
apologizing for the &lsquo;spectacle and shooting&rsquo; (<i>sair u
s&#863;hik&#257;r</i>) of Qandahar, which came with the honourable
H&#803;aidar Beg and Wal&#299; Beg, I became apprised of the bodily
health of your angelic personality, and the flowers of joy were
scattered over the world. Let it not be hidden from the world-adorning
mind of my exalted and prosperous brother that until the arrival of the
letter and messages brought by Zamb&#299;l Beg no mention had been made
by you in letters or verbal messages of your wish for Qandahar. At the
time when we were engaged in visiting the delightful land of Kashmir,
the Deccan lords, in their shortsightedness, extended their feet beyond
the limits of obedience, and trod the path of rebellion. Accordingly it
became necessary for me to chastise them. I moved my standards to
Lahore, and appointed my worthy<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7579src"
href="#xd24e7579" name="xd24e7579src">26</a> son S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n to proceed against them with a victorious army. I myself was
proceeding to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>Agra when Zamb&#299;l Beg arrived, and produced
your loving letter. I took it as a good omen, and went off to Agra to
put down the enemies and the rebels. In the jewelled and pearl-dropping
letter there was no mention of a wish for Qandahar. It was mentioned
verbally by Zamb&#299;l Beg. In reply, I said to him that I made no
difficulty with regard to anything that my brother wished. Please God,
after settling the Deccan affair, I would send him back in a manner
suitable to my sovereignty. I also said that as he had made long
marches he should repose for some days in Lahore, and that I would
afterwards send for him. After coming to Agra, I sent for him and gave
him leave to depart. As the favour of God attaches to this suppliant, I
withdrew my mind from victories and proceeded to the Panjab. My
intention was to send him away, but after disposing of some necessary
matters I went to Kashmir on account of the hot weather. After coming
there I sent for Zamb&#299;l Beg in order to give him his leave. I also
wished to show him something of that delightful country. Meanwhile news
came that my prosperous brother had come to take Qandahar. This idea
had never entered my mind, and I was entirely astonished. What could
there be in a petty village that he should set out to take it, and that
he should shut his eyes to so much friendship and brotherly feeling?
Though truthful reporters sent the news, I could not credit it! When it
became certain I immediately gave orders to
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K. not to transgress in any way the good
pleasure of that prosperous brother. Up to now the relationship of
brotherhood stands firm, and I do not value the world in comparison
therewith, nor do I consider any gift equal to it. But it would have
been right and brotherly that he should have waited till the arrival of
the ambassador. Perhaps he would be successful in the object<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7585src" href="#xd24e7585" name=

When he (&#703;Abb&#257;s) takes such steps before the return of the
ambassador, to whom will mankind ascribe the merit of keeping compacts
and of preserving the capital of humanity and liberality! May God
preserve you at all times!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">After I had given leave to the ambassadors, I devoted
all my energy to urging on the Qandahar force, and presented my son
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, who had been sent for for certain matters,
with an elephant, a special horse, a jewelled sword and dagger, and a
dress of honour. I sent him on as an advance guard, and directed him to
remain in Multan until the arrival of Prince S&#863;hahriy&#257;r with
the victorious army. B&#257;qir K., who was faujd&#257;r of Multan, was
summoned to Court, and I appointed &#703;Al&#299;-qul&#299; Beg Darman
to assist him (K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n), and raised him to the
mansab of 1,500. In the same manner, having raised M. Rustam to the
mansab of 5,000, I appointed him to the duty of assisting that son with
the (Qandahar) army. Las&#863;hkar K. came from the Deccan, and waited
on me, and was also attached to that army. Allah-d&#257;d K.

<p class="par">As the whole of my world-opening mind was taken up with
the preparation of the Qandahar army, and the remedy for that business,
the unpleasant news that reached me of a change in the condition of
K&#863;hurram, and his want of moderation, became a cause for aversion
and dissension. I accordingly sent M&#363;saw&#299; K., who is one of
the sincere servants who knows my temperament, to that wretch
(<i>b&#299;-daulat</i>) to lay before him the threatening messages and
my wishes, and to give admonitions that might sharpen his intelligence,
so that by the guidance of good fortune he might awake from the dream
of carelessness and pride, and that he (M&#363;saw&#299;) having gained
a (true) knowledge of his futile ideas and aims might hasten to my
presence, and carry out whatever appeared to be necessary. On the 1st
of the Divine month of Bahman the feast of my lunar weighing took
place. At this auspicious ceremony Mah&#257;bat K., having come from
Kabul, paid his respects, and was the recipient of special favours. I
appointed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>Ya&#703;q&#363;b K. Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;
to Kabul, exalting him with the gift of drums. About this time report
came from I&#703;tib&#257;r K. from Agra that K&#863;hurram, with the
army of adversity, had left M&#257;nd&#363; and started in that
direction. He had evidently heard the news that the treasure had been
sent for, and fire had fallen into his mind, and having let fall from
his hand the reins of self-control, had started (with the idea) that on
the road he might lay hold of the treasure. Accordingly I thought it
best to proceed for a tour, and in order to hunt to the bank of the
river of Sult&#804;&#257;n-p&#363;r (the Beas). If that wretch by the
guidance of error should place his foot in the desert of audacity, I
might hasten farther forward and place the punishment of his unbecoming
behaviour in the skirt of his fortune. If matters turned out in any
other way I might take steps accordingly. With this purpose, on the
17th of the same month, at an auspicious hour, I marched. Mah&#257;bat
K. was dignified with a dress of honour. Rs. 1,00,000 were ordered to
be given to M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam and Rs. 2,00,000 to &#703;Abdu-llah
K. by way of advance of pay. I sent M&#299;rz&#257; K&#863;h&#257;n, s.
Zain K., with a gracious farman to my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h
Parw&#299;z, and renewed my urgency for his attendance. R&#257;ja
S&#257;rang Deo had gone to summon R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo: he
came, and having paid his respects, reported that the R&#257;ja, with a
proper force and an equipped army, would join me at Thanesar. At this
time constant reports<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7624src" href=
"#xd24e7624" name="xd24e7624src">30</a> came from I&#703;tib&#257;r K.
and other servants of the State from Agra that K&#863;hurram in revolt
and disloyalty (<i>b&#299;-daulat&#299;</i>) had changed what was due
by him for rearing into undutifulnesses,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7630src" href="#xd24e7630" name="xd24e7630src">31</a> and having
placed the foot of ruin in the valley of ignorance and error, had
started in that direction. They therefore did not consider it advisable
to bring the treasure, and were engaged in strengthening the towers and
gates, and providing things necessary for the defence of the fort.
Similarly a report came from &#256;&#7779;af K. that the wretch had
torn off the veil of respect, and turned his face towards the valley of
ruin, and that the odour of good came not from the manner of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>approach. As it was not for the advantage of the
State to bring the treasure, he had entrusted it to God, and was
himself on the way to wait on me. Accordingly, having crossed the river
at Sult&#804;&#257;np&#363;r, by successive marches I proceeded to
punish that one of dark fortune, and gave an order that henceforth they
should call him <i>B&#299;-daulat</i> (wretch). Wherever in this record
of fortune &ldquo;B&#299;-daulat&rdquo; is mentioned it will refer to
him. From the kindnesses and favours bestowed upon him I can say that
up till the present time no king has conferred such on his son. What my
reverend father did for my brothers I have done for his servants,
giving them titles, standards, and drums, as has been recorded in the
preceding pages. It will not be hidden from the readers of this record
of prosperity what affection and interest I have bestowed on him. My
pen&rsquo;s tongue fails in ability to set them forth. What shall I say
of my own sufferings? In pain and weakness, in a warm atmosphere that
is extremely unsuited to my health, I must still ride and be active,
and in this state must proceed against such an undutiful son. Many
servants cherished by me for long years and raised to the dignity of
nobility, whom I ought to employ to-day in war against the Uzbeg or the
Persian, I must punish<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7641src" href=
"#xd24e7641" name="xd24e7641src">32</a> for his vileness and destroy
with my own hand. Thank God that he has given me such capacity to bear
my burdens that I can put up with all this, and go on in the same path,
and reckon them as light. But that which weighs heavily on my heart,
and places my eager temperament in sorrow is this, that at such a time
when my prosperous sons and loyal officers should be vying with each
other in the service against Qandahar and Khurasan, which would be to
the renown of the Sultanate, this inauspicious one has struck with an
axe the foot of his own dominion, and become a stumbling-block in the
path of the enterprise. The momentous affair of Qandahar must now be
postponed, but I trust that Almighty God will remove these griefs from
my heart. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=

<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that Muh&#803;tarim
K., the eunuch, K&#863;hal&#299;l Beg Z&#817;&#363;-l-qadr, and
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K., the Master of the Ceremonies, had allied
themselves with B&#299;-daulat, and opened the gates of correspondence
with him. As it was no time for mildness and winking at matters, I
imprisoned all three, and as, after making inquiry into the
circumstances, no doubt remained as to their falseness to their salt,
and about the evil designs and malevolence of K&#863;hal&#299;l and
Muh&#803;tarim, and as Amirs like M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam swore to the
insincerity and malevolence of K&#863;hal&#299;l, having no remedy I
punished them<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7647src" href="#xd24e7647"
name="xd24e7647src">33</a> capitally. Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K., the
dust of whose sincerity was free of suspicion and pure, I brought out

post (<i>d&#257;k-chauk&#299;</i>) to my son S&#863;h&#257;h
Parw&#299;z that he might bring him with all haste to wait on me; so
that B&#299;-daulat might be brought to punishment for his improper
conduct. Jaw&#257;hir K., the eunuch, was appointed to the post of
<i>Ihtim&#257;m-i-darb&#257;r-i-mah&#803;all</i> (superintendent of the
harem).</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; the royal army
arrived at N&#363;r-sar&#257;y. On this day a report came from
I&#703;tib&#257;r K., that B&#299;-daulat had arrived in all haste in
the neighbourhood of Agra, in the hope that before the fort was
strengthened, the gates of strife and mischief might be opened, and he
might attain his end. When he arrived at Fath&#803;p&#363;r, he found
the gates closed against him, and, being struck with the disgrace of
ruin, he had halted. The K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and his
son and many of the royal Amirs attached to the Deccan and Gujarat had
come with him as companions on the road of rebellion and ingratitude.
M&#363;saw&#299; K. saw him at Fath&#803;p&#363;r, and showed him the
royal orders, and it was settled that he should send his servant
Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z with him to Court to
put his requests before me. He sent to Agra his servant
Sundar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7658src" href="#xd24e7658" name=

Las&#863;hkar K., and seized Rs. 9,00,000. In the same manner, wherever
he suspected there was property in the houses of other servants (of the
Court), he stretched out his hand to seize it, and took possession of
all that he found. When nobles like
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, who had been distinguished with
the rank of &#256;t&#257;l&#299;k and arrived at the age of seventy
years, made their faces black with rebellion and ingratitude, how could
one complain of others? It may be said that his very nature was
seditious and ungrateful. His father (Bairam K.) at the end of his life
behaved in the same unbecoming way towards my reverend father. He,
following the example of his father, at his age made himself accursed
and rejected to all eternity.</p>

<p class="par first">On this day M&#363;saw&#299; K. arrived with
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z, the envoy of B&#299;-daulat. As his
requests were unreasonable, I did not allow him to speak, but handed
him over to Mah&#257;bat to be kept in prison. On the 5th of the month
I pitched on the bank of the river of L&#363;diy&#257;na (the Sutlej).
I promoted K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am to the mansab of 7,000 with
5,000 horse. R&#257;ja Bh&#257;rat, the Band&#299;la, from the Deccan,
and Day&#257;nat K. from Agra, came and waited on me. I pardoned the
offences of Day&#257;nat K., and gave him the same mansab that he had
previously held. R&#257;ja Bh&#257;rat was raised to the mansab of
1,500 and 1,000 horse, and M&#363;saw&#299; K. to that of 1,000 and 300
horse. On Thursday, the 12th, in the pargana of Th&#257;nesar,
R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, having waited on me, reviewed his army
and elicited great praise. R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo was promoted to
the mansab of 1,500 with 600 horse. In Karn&#257;l &#256;&#7779;af K.,
coming from Agra, lifted up the head of honour in kissing my stirrup.
His coming at this time was the herald of victory. Naw&#257;zis&#863;h
K., s. Sa&#703;&#299;d K., having arrived from Gujarat, paid his
respects. When B&#299;-daulat was at Burhanpur, at his request I had
appointed B&#257;q&#299; K. to J&#363;n&#257;ga&#7771;h. He had been
ordered to come to Court, and now came and shared <span class="corr"
id="xd24e7673" title="Source: n">in</span> my service. As my march from
Lahore took place without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>previous notice, and time did not
admit of delay or reflection, I came with the few Amirs who were in
attendance. Until I arrived at Sihrind only a few men had the good
fortune to accompany me, but after passing beyond it, great numbers of
the army came in from all sides and quarters. Before arrival at Delhi
such a force had come together that in any direction in which one
looked the whole plain was occupied by troops.</p>
<p class="par">As it was reported that B&#299;-daulat had left
Fath&#803;p&#363;r and was coming in this direction, and making
continuous marches towards Delhi, I gave the victorious army orders to
put on their <i>chiltas</i> (quilted coats). In this disturbance the
pivot of the management of affairs and the arrangement of the army were
entrusted to Mah&#257;bat K. The command of the vanguard was given to
&#703;Abdu-llah K. Of the selected young men and experienced
<i>sip&#257;h&#299;s</i>, whoever was asked for by him was enrolled in
his corps. I ordered him to march a koss ahead of the other forces. He
was also entrusted with the intelligence department and the control of
the routes. I was ignorant of the fact that he was in league with
B&#299;-daulat, and that the real object of that evil-natured one was
to send news from my army to him. Previously to this he used to bring
long written slips of true and false news, saying that his spies had
sent them from that place. The purport was that they (the spies)
suspected some of my servants of being in league with B&#299;-daulat,
and of sending him news. Had I been led away by his intrigues and
become alarmed at this time when the wind of disturbance was blowing
strongly I would have been obliged to destroy many of my servants.
Although some faithful servants suspected his evil intentions and
untruthfulness, the time was not one for removing the veil openly from
the face of his deeds. I guarded my eye and tongue from doing anything
which might carry terror into his evil mind, and showed him more
attention and favour than before, with the idea that possibly he would
be struck with shame, and might turn away from his evil deeds, and give
up his evil nature and sedition. That rejected one to all eternity, in
whom a tendency to vileness and falsity was natural, did <span class=

the meaning is that the archers who were footmen (see Blochmann, 254,
about <i>D&#257;k&#863;hil&#299;</i> troops) lost their vocation when
guns came into use, and became cavalry soldiers. But the meaning in

horseback. It appears from a Dast&#363;ru-l-&#703;amal in the I.O., No.

Qandahar surrendered on 11 S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, 1031, or June 11,
1622. The Shah&rsquo;s letter announcing the fact and explaining his
procedure was presented by H&#803;aidar Beg on 26 &#256;b&#257;n,
1031&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, early in November, 1622. He brought the
officers of the garrison with him. See

<h2 class="main">The Eighteenth New Year&rsquo;s Feast after the
Auspicious Accession</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the eve of Tuesday, the 20th of
Jum&#257;d&#257;-l-awwal, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1032 (March 10,
1623), the sun that lights the world entered his house of honour in
Aries, and the eighteenth year from the beginning of my reign commenced
auspiciously and happily. On this day I heard that B&#299;-daulat,
having gone to the neighbourhood of Mathura, had encamped the army
tainted with ruin in the pargana of S&#863;h&#257;hp&#363;r, and
reviewed 27,000 cavalry. It is hoped that they will soon be subdued and
miserable. R&#257;ja Jay Singh, grandson<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7715src" href="#xd24e7715" name="xd24e7715src">1</a> of R&#257;ja
M&#257;n Singh, came from his native country, and had the good fortune
to kiss my stirrup. I dignified R&#257;ja B&#299;r Singh Deo, than whom
in the Rajput caste there is no greater Amir, with the title of
Maharaja, and promoted his son Jogr&#257;j to the mansab of 2,000 with
1,000 horse. Sayyid Bahwa was presented with an elephant. As it was
reported to me that B&#299;-daulat was coming by the bank of the Jumna,
the march of the victorious army in that direction was also decided on.
The array of the army that resembled the waves of the sea was divided
into the van, the right and left wings, the <i>altmis&#863;h</i>, the
<i>t&#804;arah&#803;</i> (reserve), the <i>chand&#257;wul</i> (rear),
etc., and arranged in a manner suitable to the circumstances and
according to the locality. Close upon this came the news that
B&#299;-daulat, with the wretch K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n,
had turned his reins from the right road and gone towards the pargana
Kotila, 20 koss towards the left, along with the brahman Sundar, who
was his guide to the desert of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>error, with D&#257;r&#257;b,
s. K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, and many of the Amirs who
had accompanied him on the road of rebellion and rascality, such as
Himmat K., Sar-buland K., S&#863;harza K. &#703;&#256;bid K., J&#257;do
R&#257;y, &#362;day R&#257;m, &#256;tas&#863;h K., Man&#7779;&#363;r
K., and other mansabdars, who were attached to the Deccan, Gujarat, and
Malwa, the recital of whom would take too long, and all his own
servants, such as R&#257;ja Bh&#299;m, s. R&#257;n&#257;, Rustam K.,
Bairam Beg, the Afghan Dary&#257;, Taq&#299;, and others whom he had
left to confront the royal army. There were five<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7730src" href="#xd24e7730" name="xd24e7730src">2</a> armies
(corps?). Although nominally the command was in the hands of the wretch
(<i>bar-gas&#863;hta-i-r&#363;zg&#257;r</i>) D&#257;r&#257;b, yet in
reality the leader and centre of the whole affair was Sundar, of evil
deeds. These men of darkened fortune pitched in the neighbourhood of
Bal&#363;chp&#363;r to their ruin. On the 8th I pitched at
Qab&#363;lp&#363;r. On this day the turn to take the rear fell upon
B&#257;qir K. We had left him behind all the rest. A body of the rebels
attacked him on the march, and stretched out the hand of plunder.
B&#257;qir planted firmly the foot of courage, and succeeded in beating
them back. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan got news of this,
and turned his reins to support him. Before the arrival of the
K&#863;hw&#257;ja the rebels (<i>mard&#363;d&#257;n</i>), not being
able to stand, had taken to flight. On Wednesday, the 9th of the month,
having separated 25,000 horse under the leadership of &#256;&#7779;af
K., K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, and &#703;Abdu-llah K., I
sent them to attack the rebels who did not look to the end of things.
Q&#257;sim K., Las&#863;hkar K., Ir&#257;dat K., Fid&#257;&#702;&#299;
K., and other servants, to the number of 8,000 horse, were appointed to
&#256;&#7779;af K.&rsquo;s force. B&#257;qir K., N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n
Qul&#299;, Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain
K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299;, and others, to the number of 8,000
horse, were appointed to support Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan.
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K., &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K.,
&#703;Az&#299;zu-llah, and many of the B&#257;rha and Amroha Sayyids,
were ordered to accompany &#703;Abdu-llah. In this army 10,000 horse
were enrolled. Sundar had arranged the army of ruin and put forward the
foot of shamelessness. At this time I sent my special quiver
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>by Zabar-dast K., Master of Ceremonies, to
&#703;Abdu-llah K., that it might be the means of animating his zeal.
When the encounter of the two sides took place, that black-faced one to
all eternity, in whom the tendency to rebellion and ingratitude was
innate, taking to flight, joined the rebels.
&#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K., the son of the K&#863;h&#257;n
Daur&#257;n, God knows whether knowingly or not, went off with him.
Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K., Zabar-dast K., and S&#863;h&#299;r-h&#803;amla,
who were in the corps of that shameless one (&#703;Abdu-llah K.),
planted firmly the foot of courage, and were not disturbed at his
going. As the aid of Almighty God is ever near this suppliant, at this
crisis, when a leader of the army such as <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e7752" title="Source: &#703;Adbu-llah">&#703;Abdu-llah</span> K.
threw 10,000 cavalry into confusion and joined the enemy, and there was
nearly a great disaster, a shot from a mysterious hand reached Sundar.
At his fall the pillars of the courage of the rebels shook.
K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan also drove before him the army
in front of him and defeated it. &#256;&#7779;af K., when B&#257;qir K.
arrived, showing great activity, finished the affair, and a victory
which might be the <i>t&#804;ug&#863;hr&#257;</i> (sign manual) of the
victories of the age showed its face of purpose from the hidden world.
Zabar-dast K., S&#863;h&#299;r-h&#803;amla, S&#863;h&#299;r-bacha, his
son, and the son of Asad K., the architect, and Muh&#803;ammad
H&#803;usain, brother of K&#863;hw&#257;ja Jah&#257;n, and a number of
the Sayyids of B&#257;rha who were in the corps of the black-faced
&#703;Abdu-llah, having tasted the sweet-flavoured wine of martyrdom,
obtained everlasting life. &#703;Az&#299;zu-llah, grandson of
H&#803;usain K. (Tukr&#299;ya), being wounded by a gun-shot, got off
safely. Although at this time the desertion of that rejected hypocrite
was a secret help, yet it is probable that if he had not performed this
detestable action in the crisis of the battle, many of the rebel
leaders would have been killed or captured. It chanced that he was
known to the common people by the title of La&#703;natu-llah
(God&rsquo;s curse), and as he had received this name from the hidden
world I also called him by it. Hereafter, wherever the expression
<i>La&#703;natu-llah</i> is used it refers to him. Briefly, after the
rebels, whose end was evil, took to flight from the field of battle,
and turned their faces towards the valley of ruin and could not
reassemble, La&#703;natu-llah, with all the rebels, did not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>turn his rein till he reached B&#299;-daulat,
who was at a distance of 20 koss.</p>
<p class="par">When the news of the victory of the servants of the
State reached this suppliant to God, he prostrated himself in
thankfulness for this gift, which was from the renewed favour of Allah,
and summoned the loyal ones into his presence. On the next day they
brought before me the head of Sundar. It appeared that when the ball
struck him he gave up his soul to the lords of hell, and they took his
body to a neighbouring village to be burnt. When they were about to
light the fire, an army appeared in the distance, and for fear lest
they should be taken prisoners, everyone took to flight. The Muqaddam
(head man) of the village cut off his head, and for his own acquittal
took it to K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am, as it occurred in his
jagir. He was brought to me (with the head): the head was quite
recognizable and had as yet undergone no change, but they had cut off
the ears for the sake of the pearls in them. No one knew by whose hand
he had been shot. In consequence of his destruction, B&#299;-daulat did
not gird his loins again. One might say his good fortune and courage
and understanding lay in that dog of a Hindu. When, with a father like
me, who in truth am his ostensible creator, and in my own lifetime have
raised him to the great dignity of Sultanship, and denied him nothing,
he acts in this manner, I appeal to the justice of Allah that He may
never again regard him with favour. Those servants who in this
disturbance had done fitting service were honoured with more and more
favours, each according to his degree. K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan was raised to the mansab of 5,000, original and
increased, Naw&#257;zis&#863;h K. to that of 4,000 and 3,000 horse,
B&#257;qir K. to that of 3,000 and 500 horse, with drums,
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain K&#257;s&#863;hg&#863;har&#299; to that
of 2,000 and 1,000 horse, &#703;Az&#299;zu-llah to that of 2,000 and
1,000 horse, N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; to that of 2,000 and 700
horse, R&#257;ja R&#257;m D&#257;s to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse,
Lut&#804;fu-llah to that of 1,000 and 500 horse, Parwaris&#863;h K. to
that of 1,000 and 500 horse. If all the servants were to be written in
detail it would take too long. Briefly I remained at that place one day
and marched on the next. K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, having
marched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>from Allahabad, had the good fortune to kiss the
threshold. On the 12th of the month I encamped at the village of
Jh&#257;nsa (?).</p>
<p class="par">On this day Sar-buland R&#257;y came from the Deccan and
waited on me, and was honoured with a special jewelled dagger, with a
<i>ph&#363;l kat&#257;ra</i>. &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z K. and some
of those who had gone with La&#703;natu-llah released themselves from
the hand of B&#299;-daulat, and paid their respects, and represented
that when La&#703;natu-llah charged, they thought it was for a cavalry
encounter. When they found themselves in the midst of the rebels they
saw nothing for it but to submit and pay their respects, but now they
had found an opportunity and had obtained the good fortune of kissing
the threshold. Though they had taken 2,000 muhrs from B&#299;-daulat
for their expenses, as the times were critical I made no inquiry, but
accepted<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7773src" href="#xd24e7773" name=
"xd24e7773src">3</a> their statement.</p>
<p class="par">On the 19th the Feast of the culmination was held, and
many of the servants of the State were raised in mansab, and had
suitable favours conferred on them.</p>
<p class="par">M&#299;r &#703;Az&#803;udu-d-daulah, having come from
Agra, waited on me. He brought a vocabulary<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7780src" href="#xd24e7780" name="xd24e7780src">4</a> of words
that he had prepared. In truth he had taken much pains, and collected
together all the words from the writings of ancient poets. There is no
book like this in the science.</p>
<p class="par">R&#257;ja Jay Singh was raised to the mansab of 3,000
with 1,400 horse, and a special elephant was presented to my son
S&#863;hahriy&#257;r. The post of <i>&#703;Arz&#803;-mukarrir</i>
(examiner of petitions) was conferred on M&#363;saw&#299; K.
Am&#257;nu-llah, s. Mah&#257;bat K., was given the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n-z&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n, was favoured with a mansab of
4,000 personal and horse, and was honoured with a flag and drums.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of the Divine month of Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht
I pitched on the bank of the lake at Fath&#803;p&#363;r.
I&#703;tib&#257;r K. came from Agra and waited on me, and was
graciously received. Muz&#804;affar K., Mukarram K., and his brother
also came from Agra, and had the good fortune to wait on me. As
I&#703;tib&#257;r K. had done <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258"
href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>approved service in the
charge of the Agra fort he was dignified with the title of Mumt&#257;z
K., and I gave him the mansab of 6,000 personal and 5,000 horse, and
having bestowed on him a dress of honour, a jewelled sword, a horse,
and a special elephant, I sent him back to his duty. Sayyid Bahwa was
promoted to the mansab of 2,000 and 1,500 horse, Mukarram K. to that of
3,000 and 2,000 horse, and K&#863;hw&#257;ja Q&#257;sim to that of
1,000 with 400 horse. On the 4th Man&#7779;&#363;r K. Farang&#299;,
whose circumstances have been recorded<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7792src" href="#xd24e7792" name="xd24e7792src">5</a> in the
<span class="corr" id="xd24e7795" title=

href="#xd24e7801" name="xd24e7801src">7</a> K. Dakhan&#299;, by the
guidance of good fortune separated themselves from B&#299;-daulat, and
came into my service. I sent K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K. to my
fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z. M&#299;rz&#257;
&#703;&#298;s&#257; Tark&#863;h&#257;n, having come from Multan, had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold. A special sword was given to
Mah&#257;bat K. On the 10th the camp was pitched in the pargana of
Hindaun. Man&#7779;&#363;r K. (the Farang&#299;) was raised to the
mansab of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse, and that of Naubat<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7805src" href="#xd24e7805" name="xd24e7805src">8</a>
K. to that of 2,000 and 1,000 horse. On the 11th was a halt. As on this
day a meeting with my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z had
been arranged, I ordered that the powerful princes and the illustrious
Amirs and all the devoted servants should go out to meet him, and bring
him to wait on me in a fitting manner. After midday had passed, at an
auspicious chosen hour he kissed the ground and illuminated the
forehead of his sincerity. After the usual salutations had been
performed and the customary ceremonies gone through I embraced my
fortunate son with the greatest pleasure and affection, and loaded him
with more and more favours. At this time news came that B&#299;-daulat,
when he was passing through the township
(<i>h&#803;aw&#257;l&#299;</i>) of the pargana of Amber, which was the
hereditary abode of R&#257;ja M&#257;n Singh, had sent a band of
scoundrels and plundered that cultivated spot. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the 12th I pitched outside the village of
S&#257;rwal&#299;. I had previously sent H&#803;abas&#863;h K.
(Abyssinian) to repair the buildings at Ajmir. I promoted my fortunate
son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z to the high mansab of 40,000 and 30,000
horse. As it was reported that B&#299;-daulat had sent off Jagat Singh,
s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, to his own country to raise disturbances in the
hills of the Panjab, I promoted &#7778;&#257;diq K., chief Bakhshi, to
the governorship of that province, and ordered him to punish him,
giving him a dress of honour, with a sword and an elephant, and making
up his mansab, original and increased, to 4,000 personal and 3,000
horse. I also honoured him with a standard (<i>t&#363;gh</i>) and
drums.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was reported to me that the younger
brothers of M&#299;rz&#257; Bad&#299;&#703;u-z-zam&#257;n, s.
M&#299;rz&#257; S&#863;h&#257;hruk&#863;h, who was known as
Fath&#803;p&#363;r&#299;, had attacked him unawares and killed him.
About this time his brothers came to Court and paid their respects. His
own mother also waited on me, but did not make a claim, as was proper,
for her son&rsquo;s blood, and (so) proceedings<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7819src" href="#xd24e7819" name="xd24e7819src">9</a> could not be
taken according to law. Although his disposition was so bad that his
murder was not to be regretted, but on the contrary was opportune and
advantageous, yet, as these wretches had shown such audacity with
regard to their elder brother, who was to them in the position of a
father, I ordered them to be put in gaol, and afterwards what was
deemed proper should be done to them. On the 21st R&#257;ja Gaj Singh
and R&#257;y S&#363;raj Singh arrived from their jagirs, and had the
good fortune to kiss my stirrup. Mu&#703;izzu-l-mulk, whom I had sent
to Multan to summon my son K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, came and waited
on me, and presented me with a letter about his severe illness and
weakness. He had sent his son A&#7779;&#257;lat K. with 1,000 horse to
wait on me, and expressed great regret at being deprived of the honour
of meeting me. As his apology was evidently sincere, I accepted it. On
the 25th my fortunate son Prince Parw&#299;z, with the victorious army,
was sent in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=

of authority over the powerful Prince, and the centre of the ordering
of the victorious army, were given into the hand of
Mu&#702;taminu-d-daula Mah&#257;bat K. Of the illustrious Am&#299;rs
and life-sacrificing brave men who were in attendance on the Prince of
lofty fortune, this is the detail.</p>

of the army which accompanied him. Rs. 1,00,000 I also gave as an

was made D&#299;w&#257;n-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t.</p>
<p class="par">On the 12th of the Divine month of T&#299;r a report
came from the officials of Gujarat with the good news of victory and
conquest. The particulars of this summary are that I had granted the
Subah of Gujarat, the abode of Sultans of high dignity, to
B&#299;-daulat as a reward for his victory over the R&#257;n&#257;, as
has been fully related in the preceding pages. Sundar, the brahman,
administered and protected the country. When futile ideas entered his
ungrateful mind, he sent for that dog of a Hindu, who was always
shaking the chain of enmity and perversity, along with Himmat K.,
S&#863;harza K., Sar-afr&#257;z K., and many of the royal servants who
were fiefholders in the province. Sundar&rsquo;s brother Kunhar was
appointed in his room. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>When Sundar was killed, and
B&#299;-daulat retreated after his defeat to M&#257;nd&#363;, the
province of Gujarat was put in the charge of La&#703;natu-llah as his
fief, and Kunhar was sent for along with &#7778;af&#299; K., the diwan.
At the same time the treasure, the jewelled throne on which five lakhs
had been expended, and the <i>pardala</i> (belt) on which two lakhs had
been spent&mdash;and which things had been prepared as a present for
myself&mdash;were also sent for. &#7778;af&#299; K. was the
brother&rsquo;s son (text says &ldquo;brother&rdquo;) of Ja&#703;far
Beg, who received in my father&rsquo;s service the title of
&#256;&#7779;af K., and was married to a daughter of N&#363;r
Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s brother, who by my favour had received the title of
&#256;&#7779;af K. An elder daughter was the wife of B&#299;-daulat.
Both daughters were by one mother, and B&#299;-daulat expected that on
account of this connection &#7778;af&#299; K. would be on his side. But
an eternal decree had gone forth for &#7778;af&#299; K.&rsquo;s loyalty
and prosperity, and that he should attain to high rank! Accordingly,
Almighty God made him loyal and the performer of good deeds, as will
now be described. In short, the faithless (<i>b&#299;-waf&#257;</i>)
La&#703;natu-llah sent his eunuch named Waf&#257;-d&#257;r to be
governor of that country, and he, with a few ragamuffins
(<i>b&#299;-sar-u-p&#257;</i>) entered Ahmadabad, and took possession
of the city. As &#7778;af&#299; K. had made up his mind to be loyal, he
courageously looked after the servants, and collected a force, and won
the hearts of the people. Some days before Kunhar came out of the city
he (&#7778;af&#299;) encamped on the bank of the Kankariy&#257; lake,
and thence hastened to Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d, giving out
openly that he was going to B&#299;-daulat. Secretly, he opened
communication and made arrangements to be loyal with N&#257;hir K.,
Sayyid Dil&#299;r K., N&#257;n&#363;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7872src" href="#xd24e7872" name="xd24e7872src">13</a> K., Afghan,
and other devoted servants of the State, who were waiting in their own
jagirs. He awaited his opportunity. &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, a servant
of B&#299;-daulat, who was faujd&#257;r of the Sarkar of Pitl&#257;d,
and had a good force with him, heard rumours that &#7778;af&#299; K.
entertained other ideas. Kunhar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7876src"
href="#xd24e7876" name="xd24e7876src">14</a> had also discovered this,
but as &#7778;af&#299; K. soothed them and was very cautious and
careful in his conduct, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=
"#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>they could not move hand or foot.
&#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, for fear lest &#7778;af&#299; K., abandoning
dissimulation, should stretch his hand towards the treasure, exercised
foresight, and went farther on with the treasure, taking nearly Rs.
10,00,000 to B&#299;-daulat at M&#257;nd&#363;. Kunhar (or the younger
brother?) also, having seized the jewelled <i>pardala</i>, started
after him, but could not take the throne on account of its weight.
&#7778;af&#299; K., knowing this was his opportunity, changed his place
from Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d to the pargana of Karang,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7884src" href="#xd24e7884" name=
"xd24e7884src">15</a> which is to the left of the usual road, where
N&#257;n&#363; K. was, and arranged by letter and verbal messages with
N&#257;hir K. and other loyal servants that each of them should ride
from his jagir with the force that he had, and at the hour of sunrise,
which was the morning of prosperity for people of good fortune, and the
evening of ruin to those who practised villainy, enter the city by the
gate to which each was opposite. He (&#7778;af&#299;) left his women in
the aforesaid pargana, and, in company with N&#257;n&#363;
(B&#257;b&#363;?) K., came at dawn to the outskirts of the city. He
halted for a short time in the S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7887src" href="#xd24e7887" name=
"xd24e7887src">16</a> garden until it had become light and friend could
be distinguished from enemy. After the world-illuminating sun of good
fortune (had risen), when he found the gate of prosperity open, though
he could see no trace of N&#257;hir K. and the other loyalists, yet
lest possibly the enemy might obtain information and fasten the gates
of the fort he placed his confidence in God who gives victory, and
entered the city by the S&#257;rangp&#363;r gate. About this time
N&#257;hir K. also arrived, and, entering by the gate, came into the
city. The eunuch of La&#703;natu-llah, having ascertained the unfailing
good fortune of (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r), took refuge in the house of
S&#863;haik&#863;h H&#803;aidar, grandson of Niz&#804;&#257;m
Waj&#299;hu-d-d&#299;n. The royal servants <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>of
approved service, having proclaimed their victory with loud voices, set
to work to strengthen the towers and gates. They sent men to the houses
of Muh&#803;ammad Taq&#299;, B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s diwan, and of
H&#803;asan Beg, his Bakhshi, and seized them. S&#863;haik&#863;h
H&#803;aidar himself came and informed &#7778;af&#299; K. that the
eunuch of La&#703;natu-llah was in his house, and they tied his hands
to his neck, and brought him. Having imprisoned a number of
B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s servants and dependants, they engaged in keeping
order in the city. The jewelled throne, the cash of Rs. 2,00,000, and
the property and effects of B&#299;-daulat and his men in the city,
came into their possession. When this news reached B&#299;-daulat, he
sent off La&#703;natu-llah with Himmat K., S&#863;harza K.,
Sar-afr&#257;z K., Q&#257;bil Beg, Rustam Bah&#257;dur,
&#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, and other criminals.
What with royal servants and his own men, he had some 5,000 or 6,000
horse. &#7778;af&#299; K. and N&#257;hir K., becoming aware of this,
planted firmly the foot of courage, and employed themselves in
encouraging their men and collecting forces. Whatever cash and
valuables they could obtain, even to the throne, which they broke up,
they divided amongst both the old and new troopers as pay. R&#257;ja
Kaly&#257;n, Zamindar of &#298;dar (printed wrongly
&ldquo;And&#363;r&rdquo;), and the son of L&#257;l Gop&#299;
(?)<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7893src" href="#xd24e7893" name=
"xd24e7893src">17</a>, and all the Zamindars from every quarter, were
summoned into the city. A good number was thus assembled.
La&#703;natu-llah did not wait for auxiliaries, and in the space of
eight days came from M&#257;nd&#363; to Baroda. The loyal party, by the
guidance of their courage, and in reliance on God, came out of the city
and encamped on the bank of the K&#257;nkariy&#257; Lake. It occurred
to La&#703;natu-llah that if he came on quickly, the rope of order of
the loyal might be broken. When he obtained news of the coming out of
the loyal servants, drawing in the reins of ruin, he delayed in Baroda
till the arrival of help. After the evil-ending criminals collected
together at that chief place of mischief, he put forward the foot of
error and deviation from the right path, and the loyal party, marching
from the K&#257;nkariy&#257; tank, encamped outside the village of
Batoh, near the mausoleum of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>Qut&#804;b &#703;&#256;lam.
La&#703;natu-llah traversed a road of three days in two,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7898src" href="#xd24e7898" name=
"xd24e7898src">18</a> and arrived at Mah&#803;m&#363;d&#257;b&#257;d.
As Sayyid Dil&#299;r K. had seized the women of S&#863;harza K. and
brought them from Baroda to the city, and the women of Sar-afr&#257;z
K. were also in the city, &#7778;af&#299; K. sent a secret message to
both of them that if by the guidance of good fortune they would rub off
the stain of sin (rebellion) from the tablet of their foreheads, and
would enrol themselves among the loyal servants, their position in the
present and future worlds would approach salvation; otherwise he would
subject their wives and children to all kinds of indignities. Hearing
this, La&#703;natu-llah sent for Sar-afr&#257;z K. on some excuse to
his house, and imprisoned him. As S&#863;harza K., Himmat K., and
&#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; were in league
together, and had alighted at the same place, he could not get
S&#863;harza K. into his hands. Briefly, on the 21st of
S&#863;ha&#703;b&#257;n, <span class="sc">A.H.</span> 1032, June 10,
1623, La&#703;natu-llah mounted and arrayed the forces tinged with
calamity. Those who were loyal also arrayed their forces and prepared
for the fight. It occurred to La&#703;natu-llah that if he were to go,
their foot of courage would not stand firm, and, without a battle
taking place, they would be dispersed in a miserable condition. When he
saw the firm attitude of the loyal, he could not screw up his courage
(<i>t&#257;b nay&#257;warda</i>), but turned his rein towards the left,
and gave out that they had hidden gunpowder under the ground of that
plain, and that his men would be destroyed by it&mdash;that it would
therefore be better to go into the plain of Sarkhej and deliver battle
there. These futile ideas were due to the aid of good fortune, for on
the turning back of his rein a rumour of his defeat was spread abroad,
and the horsemen of the plain of victory attacked him in flank, and
that ill-omened one was unable to reach Sarkhej, and halted in the
village of N&#257;ranja. The loyal party arranged their forces in the
village of B&#257;l&#363;d, which is nearly three koss off. At dawn on
the next day they went to battle after the approved manner, their
forces being drawn up in this way. In the vanguard were N&#257;hir K.,
R&#257;ja Kaly&#257;n, the Zamindar of &#298;dar, and other valiant
men; on the left wing Sayyid Dil&#299;r K., Sayyid S&#299;d&#363;,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>and other loyal servants were stationed; and on
the right wing N&#257;n&#363; K., Sayyid Ya&#703;q&#363;b, Sayyid
G&#863;hul&#257;m Muh&#803;ammad, and the rest of the life-sacrificing
devoted ones, whilst in the centre were &#7778;af&#299; K.,
Kif&#257;yat K. Bak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;, and some other servants of
approved service. It so happened, fortunately, that in the place where
La&#703;natu-llah had halted, the land was undulating, full of thorn
brakes and narrow lanes. The forces, accordingly, were not in compact
order. He had sent on most of the experienced men with Rustam
Bah&#257;dur, and Himmat K., and &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Beg were
amongst the foremost in (the ranks of) error. The army doomed to
calamity first of all came in contact with N&#257;hir K. and
S&#863;hams K., and a notable fight took place. By chance Himmat K.
fell in the dust of destruction from a gun-shot wound, and a fight
ensued between &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Beg, and N&#257;n&#363; K.,
Sayyid Ya&#703;q&#363;b, Sayyid G&#863;hul&#257;m Muh&#803;ammad, and
other servants. In the height of the battle the elephant of Sayyid
G&#863;hul&#257;m Muh&#803;ammad came and threw him
(&#7778;&#257;lih&#803;) from his horse; he fell severely wounded to
the ground, and about a hundred of his men were slain. At this moment
an elephant which was in the van of the rebel army turned round at the
noise of the rockets and the lightning of the guns, and got into a
narrow lane, on both sides of which were thorn brakes, and trod down
many of the rebels. By the turning back of the elephant the ranks of
the enemy were disordered. At this moment Sayyid Dil&#299;r K. came
fighting from the right wing. La&#703;natu-llah did not know of the
killing of Himmat K. and &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, and, with the idea of
helping them, urged on the steed of ruin. As the brave ones in the van,
having displayed activity, had been mostly wounded, they could not
stand the onset of La&#703;natu-llah, and turned back their rein, and
it nearly happened that there was a great disaster. At this time the
assistance of God displayed itself, and &#7778;af&#299; K. hastened
from the centre to the support of the van. Just then La&#703;natu-llah
heard of the killing of Himmat K. and &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; Beg, and,
on the appearance of the centre and the attack of &#7778;af&#299; K.,
his courage failed him, and he became a vagabond in the desert of
defeat and disaster. Sayyid Dil&#299;r K. pursued him for a koss, and
made many of the defeated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href=
"#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>the harvest of the sword of
vengeance. Q&#257;bil Beg, unfaithful to his salt, with a body of
rebels, became captives in the claws of retribution. As
La&#703;natu-llah was not sure about Sar-afr&#257;z K., he on the day
of battle placed him in chains on an elephant and put him in charge of
one of his slaves, with orders that if a defeat occurred he should kill
him. In like manner he placed in chains on one of the elephants
Bah&#257;dur, s. Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad, and gave permission to
kill him. When the fight took place the man in charge of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Ah&#803;mad&rsquo;s son put him to death with a
dagger, but Sar-afr&#257;z K. threw himself down off the elephant. The
man in charge of him in that confusion aimed a blow at him in his
bewilderment, but it was not effectual. &#7778;af&#299; K., finding him
in the fight, sent him into the city. La&#703;natu-llah did not turn
back till he arrived at Baroda. As the women of S&#863;harza K. were
captives of those who were loyal, he was helpless, and came and waited
upon &#7778;af&#299; K. Briefly, La&#703;natu-llah hastened from Baroda
to Broach. The sons of Himmat K. were in the fort there. Although they
did not admit him, yet they sent him 5,000
<i>mah&#803;m&#363;d&#299;s</i> by way of maintenance. For three days
he remained outside the fort of Broach in a wretched state, and on the
fourth went to Surat by sea. For nearly two months he remained there
assembling his scattered men. As Surat was in B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s
jagir, he took nearly 4 lakhs of <i>mah&#803;m&#363;d&#299;s</i> from
his officials there, and took possession of whatever he could by
oppression and injustice. He again collected together those whose
fortune was reversed and whose stars had been burnt, and betook himself
to B&#299;-daulat at Burhanpur.</p>
<p class="par">In fine, when this approved service performed by
&#7778;af&#299; K. and other loyal servants in Gujarat became known,
each one was exalted with favours and kindnesses. &#7778;af&#299; K.

3,000 personal and 2,000 horse, I honoured him with the title of Saif

given him the mansab of 3,000 with 2,000 horse, I bestowed on him the

R&#257;ys&#299;n and Chander&#299;. When S&#863;h&#299;r K., the Afghan
(<i>i.e.</i>, S&#863;h&#299;r S&#863;h&#257;h), besieged the fort of
R&#257;ys&#299;n, it is well known that he killed him (P&#363;ran Mal)
after promising him quarter, and that his women burnt themselves,
committing &ldquo;<i>Johar</i>,&rdquo; according to the Hindu custom,
in the fire of fame and modesty, so that the hand of no unlawful person
should touch the skirt of their chastity. His sons and caste fellows
went off to various<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7931src" href=
"#xd24e7931" name="xd24e7931src">20</a> places. The father of
N&#257;hir K., whose title was K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, having gone
to Muh&#803;ammad K., governor of &#256;s&#299;r and Burhanpur, became
a Musalman, and when Muh&#803;ammad K. died, H&#803;asan, his son, when
in tender years, succeeded him. R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299; K., brother of
Muh&#803;ammad K., put the child in confinement, and took possession of
the government. After some time news reached R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299;
K. that K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n and a body of the servants of
Muh&#803;ammad K. had leagued together to attack him, and had
determined to take H&#803;asan K. out of the fort and raise him to
power. He was beforehand with them, and sent H&#803;ay&#257;t
K&#863;h&#257;n H&#803;abas&#863;h&#299;, with many brave men, to the
house of K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, either to take him <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e7936" title="Source: alike">alive</span> or to kill
him. He, planting his foot firmly on his good fame, took to fighting,
and when things went badly with him committed <i>Johar</i>, and passed
from this borrowed life. At that time N&#257;hir K. was very young.
H&#803;ay&#257;t K&#863;h&#257;n Abyssinian, having asked
&#703;Al&#299; K.&rsquo;s permission, adopted him as his son, and made
him a Musalman. After his death R&#257;ja &#703;Al&#299; K. brought up
N&#257;hir K., and took good care of him. When my revered father
conquered &#256;s&#299;r, N&#257;hir K. joined his service. He (Akbar)
discerned the signs of bravery on his forehead, and raised him to a
suitable mansab, and gave him in jagir the pargana of
Muh&#803;ammadp&#363;r in Malwa. In my service he advanced more and
more. Now that the grace of gratitude has been bestowed upon him, he
has found the advantage of doing what was right. <span class=

<p class="par">Sayyid Dil&#299;r K. is of the Sayyids of B&#257;rha;
formerly his name was Sayyid &#703;Abdu-l-Wahh&#257;b. I raised him
from the mansab of 1,000 and 800 horse to 2,000 and 1,200 horse, and
presented him with a standard. They call twelve <i>b&#257;ra</i> in
Hindi. As in the D&#363;-&#257;b there are twelve villages near each
other which are the native country of these Sayyids, they have become
known as the Sayyids of B&#257;rha. Some people make remarks about
their lineage, but their bravery is a convincing proof of their being
Sayyids, for there has never been a battle in this reign in which they
have not been conspicuous, and in which some have not been killed.
M&#299;rz&#257; &#703;Az&#299;z Koka always said the Sayyids of
B&#257;rha were the averters of calamity from this dominion, and such
is in reality the case.</p>
<p class="par">N&#257;n&#363; K. Afghan held the mansab of 800 personal
and horse: it was ordered to be one of 1,500 personal and 1,200 horse.
In the same manner the other loyal servants, according to their
services and sacrifices, were promoted to high mansabs, and obtained
the desire of their hearts in lofty employments. At this time
A&#7779;&#257;lat K., s. K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, was deputed to the
assistance of my son (grandson) D&#257;war-bak&#863;hs&#863;h in
Gujarat, and I sent N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; into the Subah to
bring S&#863;harza K., Sar-afr&#257;z K., and the other leaders of the
rebel army who had been made captive in the land of retribution,
chained, to the Court.</p>
<p class="par">On this day it was reported to me that Min&#363;-chihr,
s. S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K., had separated himself from
B&#299;-daulat under the guidance of good fortune, and had joined the
service of my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z.
I&#703;tiq&#257;d K., governor of Kashmir, was promoted to the mansab
of 4,000 personal and 3,000 horse.</p>
<p class="par">As the huntsmen brought news that in this neighbourhood
a tiger had made its appearance, I felt disposed to hunt it. After
entering the forest three other tigers became visible. Having killed
all four, I returned to the palace. I have such a liking for tiger
shooting that whilst I can get it I do not go after other sport.
Sult&#804;&#257;n Mas&#703;&#363;d, s. Sult&#804;&#257;n
Mah&#803;m&#363;d (of Ghaznin) (may the lights of Allah be his
testimony!), was also much inclined to tiger shooting. With regard to
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>killing of tigers strange tales have been
recorded, especially in the history of Baihaq&#299;,<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e7956src" href="#xd24e7956" name="xd24e7956src">21</a> who has
kept a diary of what he saw with his own eyes. Among these things he
writes that one day he (Mas&#703;&#363;d) went to hunt tigers in the
borders of Hindustan, and was riding an elephant. A very large tiger
came out from the wood, and made for the elephant. He threw a javelin
(<i>k&#863;his&#863;ht</i>) and struck the tiger&rsquo;s chest. The
tiger, enraged at the pain, came up on the elephant&rsquo;s back, and
the Amir knelt down and struck him such a blow with his sword that he
cut off both the tiger&rsquo;s fore-feet, and the tiger fell backwards
and died. It happened to me once when I was prince that I had gone out
in the Punjab to hunt tigers. A powerful tiger appeared out of the
wood. I fired at him from the elephant and the tiger in great fury rose
and came on the elephant&rsquo;s back, and I had not time to put down
my gun and seize my sword. Inverting the gun, I knelt, and with both
hands struck him with the stock over the head and face so that he fell
on to the ground and died.</p>
<p class="par">One of the strange things that happened was that one day
I was on an elephant, and was hunting wolves in Aligarh<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7964src" href="#xd24e7964" name=
"xd24e7964src">22</a> in the N&#363;h forest. A wolf appeared, and I
struck it with a bullet on its face (<i>mana</i>) near the lobe of the
ear. The bullet penetrated for about a span. From that bullet it fell
and gave up its life. It has often happened in my presence that
powerful (<i>jaw&#257;n&#257;n</i>) men, good shots with the bow, have
shot twenty or thirty arrows at them, and not killed. As it is not
right to write about oneself, I must restrain the tongue of my pen from
saying more.</p>
<p class="par">On the 29th of the month I presented a string of pearls
to Jagat Singh, s. R&#257;n&#257; Karan. At this time it was reported
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>me that Sult&#804;&#257;n H&#803;usain, Zamindar
of Pakl&#299;, had died. I gave his mansab and jagir to
S&#863;h&#257;dm&#257;n, his eldest son.</p>
<p class="par">On the 7th of the month of Amurd&#257;d
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain, a servant of my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, came from the victorious army, and brought
news of the victory of the chiefs of the everlasting State. The report
of my son laid before me the particulars of the fight, and the
exertions of the brave and distinguished men in it. I performed the
dues of thanksgiving for this favour, which was of God&rsquo;s grace
alone. The details of this are as follows: When the royal troops in the
army of the prince of high degree crossed the pass of
Ch&#257;n&#7693;&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7994src" href=
"#xd24e7994" name="xd24e7994src">23</a> and entered the province of
Malwa, B&#299;-daulat, with 20,000 horse, 300 fighting elephants, and a
large force of artillery, left M&#257;nd&#363; in order to fight. He
dispatched a body of the Barg&#299;s (Mahrattas) of the Deccan with
J&#257;d&#363; R&#257;y and &#362;day R&#257;m, &#256;las&#863;h K.,
and other rebels to make a raid (<i>qazz&#257;q&#299;</i>) on the royal
camp. Mah&#257;bat K. made proper arrangements. He placed the
illustrious prince in the <i>g&#863;haul</i> (centre), and he himself
proceeded with the whole army, and in marching and in halting observed
the conditions of caution. The Barg&#299;s kept at a great distance,
and did not put forward the foot of bravery. One day it was
Man&#7779;&#363;r K. Farang&#299;&rsquo;s turn to be with the
rear-guard. At the time of pitching the camp Mah&#257;bat K., by way of
caution, was standing with his army drawn up outside the camp, in order
that the men might fence it in at their ease. As Man&#7779;&#363;r K.
had been drinking on the road, he was coming to the stage drunk with
the wine of pride. It happened an army was seen in the distance, and
the wine put the idea into his head that he must charge. Without
telling his brothers or his men, he mounted and charged, and drove off
two or three Barg&#299;s, and came to where J&#257;d&#363; R&#257;y and
&#362;day R&#257;m were standing with two or three thousand cavalry
drawn up. As was their custom, they attacked him from all sides and
surrounded him. He fought as long as there was breath in his body, and
gave up his life on the path of loyalty.</p>
<p class="par">During these days Mah&#257;bat K. was continually
capturing, by messages and letters, the afflicted hearts of a number of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>men who out of timidity and confusion had
accompanied B&#299;-daulat. When men read the lines of despair on the
page of his (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s) condition, letters
also came from that side, asking for agreements (<i>qaul</i>). After
B&#299;-daulat came out of the fort of M&#257;nd&#363;, he in the first
instance sent forward a body of Barg&#299;s, and after them he sent
Rustam K., Taq&#299;, and Barq-and&#257;z K. with a body of musketeers.
Then he sent D&#257;r&#257;b K., Bh&#299;m, Bairam Beg, and his other
active men. As he could not resolve to give battle in person, he was
continually looking backwards. He crossed the war-elephants over the
Narbadda with the artillery waggons, and went himself unattended behind
D&#257;r&#257;b and Bh&#299;m, turning his face of ruin towards the
battle. On the day when the royal camp was pitched at
K&#257;liy&#257;daha, B&#299;-daulat sent his army against the
victorious forces, and stationed himself with
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and a few men at the distance of
a koss in the rear. Barq-and&#257;z K., who had made an agreement with
Mah&#257;bat K., was lying in wait. When the armies were ranged
opposite to each other, he got his opportunity, and attacked with a
body of musketeers, and joined the royal army, crying out,
&ldquo;Success to King Jah&#257;ng&#299;r!&rdquo; When he reached
Mah&#257;bat K., the latter took him to wait on my fortunate son
Parw&#299;z, who bestowed royal favours upon him. Previously he bore
the name of Bah&#257;&#702;u-d-d&#299;n, and was a servant of Zain K.
After the latter&rsquo;s death he enlisted among the Turkish gunners.
As he was active in the performance of his duty, and had a band of men
with him, considering him worthy of patronage, I gave him the title of
Barq-and&#257;z K. When I sent B&#299;-daulat to the Deccan, I put him
at the head of the artillery, and sent him with him. Although in the
beginning he placed the scar of curse on the forehead of his obedience,
yet in the end he turned out well and came at a good time. On the same
day Rustam, who was one of his (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s)
chief servants and on whom he had perfect reliance, when he found that
Fortune had turned away from him, made a compact with Mah&#257;bat K.
By the guidance of good fortune and reliance on God, he, with
Muh&#803;ammad Mur&#257;d Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299; and other
mansabdars, left the ill-fated army, and joined that of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>illustrious prince. B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s hand
and heart were paralyzed on hearing this news, and he suspected all his
own servants, and still more the royal servants he had with him, of
faithlessness and unreliability. During the night he sent for the men
who were in front, and decided on flight, and in bewilderment crossed
the Narbadda. At this time, again, some of his servants took the
opportunity of separating themselves from him, and joined the service
of my fortunate son. Each of them received favours according to his
condition. On the day that he crossed the river Narbadda, a letter fell
into the hand of one of his men, that Mah&#257;bat K. had written in
answer to Z&#257;hid&rsquo;s K. letter, making him hopeful of the royal
favour, and urging him to come in. This they sent direct to
B&#299;-daulat, and he, becoming suspicious of Z&#257;hid K.,
imprisoned him with his three sons. Z&#257;hid K. is s.
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K., who was one of the Amirs and trusted
servants of my revered father. I had patronized this wretch in
consideration of his claims of service and of his position as a
house-born one (<i>kh&#257;na-z&#257;d</i>), and given him the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n and the rank of 1,500, and had sent him with
B&#299;-daulat for the conquest of the Deccan. When I summoned the
Amirs of that quarter on account of the business of Qandahar, although
a special farman of urgency was sent to him, the wretch did not come to
Court, and gave himself out as an adherent and devoted servant of
B&#299;-daulat. After the defeat near Delhi, he turned back.
Though<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8015src" href="#xd24e8015" name=
"xd24e8015src">24</a> he had not a family, he had not the good fortune
to pay his respects, or to cleanse the dust of shame and the stain of
sin from the tablet of his forehead. At last the True Recompenser
caught him on this day, and his property, to the extent of one lac and
Rs. 30,000, was confiscated by B&#299;-daulat.</p>

<p class="par">Briefly, B&#299;-daulat having quickly crossed the
Narbadda, drew all the boats over to that side, and having secured the
fords with men that he trusted, he left Bairam Beg, his Bakhshi, with a
force of trustworthy men and a body of the Barg&#299;s from the Deccan
on the bank of the river. Taking the artillery-waggons, he himself went
towards the fort of &#256;s&#299;r and to Burhanpur. Meanwhile
Taq&#299;, his servant, caught the runner whom
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n had sent to Mah&#257;bat K., and
took him to B&#299;-daulat. This couplet was written on the margin of
the letter:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Hundreds are watching me</p>
<p class="line">Otherwise I&rsquo;d fly away from trouble.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">B&#299;-daulat sent for him with his sons from his
quarters, and showed him the writing. Although he made excuses, he
could give no answer that could be listened to. In short, he kept him
with D&#257;r&#257;b and his other sons in surveillance near his own
station, and the lot he had himself drawn&mdash;viz., that hundreds
were watching him&mdash;happened to him. At this time I gave
Ibr&#257;h&#299;m H&#803;usain, the servant of my prosperous son who
had brought the report of the victory, the title of
K&#863;h&#363;s&#863;h-k&#863;habar K., with a dress of honour, and an
elephant, and sent a gracious farman to the Prince and Mah&#257;bat K.
by K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K. I also sent with him a

"#xd24e8039" name="xd24e8039src">26</a> (bracelet) of great value to my
son (Parw&#299;z) and a jewelled sword to Mah&#257;bat K. As
Mah&#257;bat K. had done approved service, I gave him the mansab of
7,000 personal and horse.</p>
<p class="par">Sayyid &#7778;al&#257;bat K., having come from the
Deccan, had the good fortune to pay his respects, and received special
favours. He was one of those employed in the Deccan. When
B&#299;-daulat, having been defeated near Delhi, went to the fort of
M&#257;nd&#363;, he placed his children in independent territory under
the protection of God, and went off by secret routes to pay his
respects (to me). M&#299;rz&#257; H&#803;asan, s. M&#299;rz&#257;
Rustam &#7778;afaw&#299;, having obtained leave to proceed to his
appointment as faujd&#257;r of Bahraich, was given the mansab of 1,500
personal and 500 horse, original and increased. Having sent La&#703;l
Beg, Superintendent of the Record Department, to my fortunate son
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, I sent with him a
special dress of honour and a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> for him, and a
turban for Mah&#257;bat K. K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K., who had
previously been sent to him and had returned, waited upon me with good
news (of him). K&#863;h&#257;na-z&#257;d K., s. Mah&#257;bat K., was
given the mansab of 5,000 personal and horse.</p>
<p class="par">At this time I enjoyed myself for a day with hunting
n&#299;lg&#257;w. Whilst I was hunting I saw a snake the length of
which was 2&frac12; yards, and its girth equal to three cubits
(<i>dast</i>). He had swallowed half a hare, and was in the act of
swallowing the other half. When the huntsmen picked him up and brought
him to me, the hare fell out of his mouth. I ordered them to put it
into its mouth again, but they could not do it, however much they
exerted themselves; but by using great violence the corner of his mouth
was torn to pieces. After this I ordered them to open its belly.
Thereupon another entire hare came out. They call this kind of snake
<i>ch&#299;tal</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e8056src" href=
"#xd24e8056" name="xd24e8056src">27</a> in Hindustan, and it grows so
large that it swallows a hog-deer (<i>kot&#257;h-p&#257;cha</i>)
entire; but it is not poisonous, and does not bite. One day during the
same hunt I shot a female n&#299;lg&#257;w, and two fully formed young
ones were found inside. As I heard that the flesh of n&#299;lg&#257;w
fawns was delicate and delicious, I ordered the royal cooks to prepare
a <i>d&#363;-piy&#257;za</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e8064src" href=
"#xd24e8064" name="xd24e8064src">28</a> (a kind of rich fricassee).
Certainly it was not without flavour.</p>
<p class="par">On the 15th of the Divine month of S&#863;hahr&#299;war
Rustam K., Muh&#803;ammad Mur&#257;d, and several other servants of
B&#299;-daulat, who under the guidance of good luck had separated
themselves from him and entered the service of my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, according to orders came to Court, and had
the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Having promoted Rustam K. to
the mansab of 5,000 personal and 4,000 horse, and Muh&#803;ammad
Mur&#257;d to that of 1,000 personal and 500 horse, I made them hopeful
of daily increasing favours. Rustam K. by extraction is a
Badak&#863;hs&#863;h&#299;. His name was Y&#363;suf Beg. He is
connected with Muh&#803;ammad-qul&#299; of Isfahan, who was agent for
and prime minister of M&#299;rz&#257; Sulaim&#257;n (of Badakhshan). He
was first of all in the service of the Court, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>and
passed his days mostly in the Subahs. He was included among the smaller
mansabdars. Having been deprived of his jagir for some reason, he came
to B&#299;-daulat, and entered his service. He had a perfect knowledge
of tiger-hunting. He also did good service with him, especially in the
affair of the R&#257;n&#257;. B&#299;-daulat selected him out of all
his servants, and made him an Amir. As I bestowed much favour on him
(S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n), at his request I gave him the title of
K&#863;h&#257;n, with a standard and drums. For some time he conducted
as his agent the government of Gujarat, and did not manage badly.
Muh&#803;ammad Mur&#257;d is the son of Maq&#7779;&#363;d
M&#299;r-&#257;b (butler), who was one of the old servants of
M&#299;rz&#257; Sulaim&#257;n and M&#299;rz&#257;
S&#863;h&#257;h-ruk&#863;h.</p>
<p class="par">On this day Sayyid Bahwa came from Gujarat, and waited
on me. N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n Qul&#299; brought in chains to the Court
forty-one of the rebels, who had been taken prisoners at Ahmadabad.
S&#863;harza K. and Q&#257;bil Beg, who were ring-leaders of the
seditious, I executed by throwing them under the feet of warlike
(<i>mast</i>) elephants. On the 20th of the same month, corresponding
with the 18th of the month of Z&#817;&#299;-qa&#703;da, a daughter was

the 22nd of the month the feast of my solar weighment took place, and
the 55th year of the age of this suppliant began auspiciously and
happily. According to annual custom, I had myself weighed against gold
and other valuables, and gave them to deserving people. Among these I
gave Rs. 2,000 to S&#863;haik&#863;h Ah&#803;mad<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8082src" href="#xd24e8082" name="xd24e8082src">31</a> of Sihrind.
On the 1st of the Divine month of Mihr M&#299;r Jumla was promoted to
the mansab of 3,000 personal and 300 horse. Muq&#299;m, the Bakhshi of
Gujarat, was given the title of Kif&#257;yat K. As the innocence of
Sar-far&#257;z K.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8085src" href="#xd24e8085"
name="xd24e8085src">32</a> was established to my satisfaction, I took
him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>out of prison, and allowed him to pay his
respects. At the request of my son S&#863;hahriy&#257;r, I went to his
house. He had prepared a grand entertainment, and presented suitable
offerings, and gave dresses of honour to most of the servants.</p>
<p class="par">At this time a report came from my fortunate son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z that B&#299;-daulat had crossed the river
of Burhanpur (the Tapt&#299;), and was wandering in the desert of
error. The particulars are that when he crossed the Narbadda and drew
all the boats to that side, and fortified the banks of the river and
the ferries with cannon and muskets, he left Bairam Beg on the bank
with a large number of the rebels, and withdrew towards &#256;s&#299;r
and Burhanpur. The K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and
D&#257;r&#257;b he took with him under surveillance.</p>
<p class="par">And now, for the sake of enlivening my narrative, a few
words must be said about &#256;s&#299;r. The said fort, in its great
height and strength, is not in want of my praise. Before B&#299;-daulat
went to the Deccan it was in the charge of K&#863;hw&#257;ja
Na&#7779;ru-llah, s. K&#863;hw&#257;ja Fath&#803;u-llah, who was one of
the household slaves and ancient servants. Afterwards, at the request
of B&#299;-daulat, it was handed over to M&#299;r
H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, s. M&#299;r Jam&#257;lu-d-d&#299;n
H&#803;usain.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8095src" href="#xd24e8095"
name="xd24e8095src">33</a> As the daughter of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n
Begam&rsquo;s maternal uncle (<i>tagh&#257;&#702;&#299;</i>) was
married<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8101src" href="#xd24e8101" name=
"xd24e8101src">34</a> to him, when B&#299;-daulat, having been defeated
in the neighbourhood of Delhi, turned his rein towards Malwa and
M&#257;nd&#363;, N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam wrote to him and strictly
urged him, saying: &ldquo;Beware, a thousand times beware, not to allow
B&#299;-daulat and his men to come near the fort, but strengthen the
towers and gates, and do your duty, and do not act in such a manner
that the stain of a curse and ingratitude for favours should fall on
the honour or the forehead of a Sayyid.&rdquo; In truth, he
strengthened it well, and the arrangements of the fort were not of such
a sort that B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s bird of thought could fly up to its
border, or the conquest of it be quickly accomplished. In brief, when
B&#299;-daulat sent one of his attendants, of the name <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>of
S&#863;har&#299;f&#257;, to the above-mentioned, he
(S&#863;har&#299;f&#257;) seduced him by means of promises and threats,
and it was settled (between S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n and
S&#863;har&#299;f&#257;) that when H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n should
come down to take the letter and dress of honour which had been sent,
he should not be allowed to go up again. That wretch, immediately
S&#863;har&#299;f&#257; arrived, put away on the shelf of forgetfulness
what he owed on account of his bringing up and the favours conferred on
him, and without opposition or effort handed over the fort to
S&#863;har&#299;f&#257;, and with his wife<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8108src" href="#xd24e8108" name="xd24e8108src">35</a> and child
went to B&#299;-daulat, who made him accursed of the Faith and in the
world by bestowing on him the mansab of 4,000 personal, and a standard
and drums, and the title of Murtaz&#803;&#257; K.&mdash;a disgraceful
name to all eternity.</p>
<p class="par">In short, when that one of reversed fortune reached the
foot of the fort of &#256;s&#299;r, he took with him
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, D&#257;r&#257;b, and all his
evil-minded offspring up to the fort, and remaining there for three or
four days, and having set his mind at ease about provisions, etc.,
handed it over to one Gop&#257;l D&#257;s, a Rajput, who had formerly
been an attendant of Sar-buland R&#257;y, and entered his service when
he went to the Deccan. He left the women and his superfluous baggage,
and took with him his three wives with their children and some
maid-servants. At first he proposed to imprison
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and D&#257;r&#257;b in the fort,
but at last changed his mind, and bringing them down with him, hastened
to Burhanpur. At this time La&#703;natu-llah, after suffering disgrace
and contempt, came from Surat and joined him. In great perplexity,
B&#299;-daulat employed Sar-buland R&#257;y, the son of R&#257;y Bhoj
H&#257;r&#257;, who is one of the brave Rajput servants, and who is fed
from the royal table (?), as his mediator, and by letters and messages
made proposals of peace. Mah&#257;bat K. said that until
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n came, peace was impossible. His
(Mah&#257;bat&rsquo;s) sole purpose was by these means to separate from
him that head of deceivers who was the ring-leader of trouble and
sedition. Being helpless, B&#299;-daulat brought him
(K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n) out of prison, and satisfied
himself by taking an oath from him on the Qoran. In order to please him
and strengthen his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279"
name="pb279">279</a>]</span>promises and oath, he took him inside the
female apartment and made a confidant<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8116src" href="#xd24e8116" name="xd24e8116src">36</a> of him, and
brought his own wife and son to him, and made use of all kinds of
entreaty and lamentation. The gist of his (S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s) remarks was: &ldquo;My times are hard, and my
position difficult; I make myself over to you, and make you the
guardian of my honour. You must act so that I no longer undergo
contempt and confusion.&rdquo; The
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, with a view to bring about
peace, parted from B&#299;-daulat and proceeded to the royal army. It
was settled that he should remain on the other side of the river, and
arrange matters relating to peace in writing. According to fate, before
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n arrived on the bank of the
river, some of the brave warriors and victorious youths one night found
an opportunity and crossed over at a place where the rebels were
careless. On hearing this news the pillars of their courage trembled,
and Bairam Beg could not keep firm the foot of error and ignorance, or
engage in driving them back. Whilst he was in this agitation<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8121src" href="#xd24e8121" name=
"xd24e8121src">37</a> many crossed the river, and on the same night the
rebels of evil fortune were separated from each other like the
<i>Ban&#257;tu-n-na&#703;&#257;s&#863;h</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8133src" href="#xd24e8133" name="xd24e8133src">38</a> and took to
flight. By the unfailing good fortune (of Jah&#257;ng&#299;r) the
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n fell into perplexity (lit. fell
into the <i>s&#863;has&#863;h-dar</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8142src" href="#xd24e8142" name="xd24e8142src">39</a> position),
and could neither go nor stay where he was. At this time again letters
arrived from my prosperous son mingling threats with promises. The
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n, finding only despair and ruin
in the page of B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s affairs, hastened, through the
mediation of Mah&#257;bat K., to wait upon my fortunate son.
B&#299;-daulat, on hearing of the departure of
K&#863;h&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;n&#257;n and the crossing of the Narbadda
by the victorious army and the flight of Bairam Beg, lost courage, and,
notwithstanding a flood in the river and the violence of the rain,
crossed the Tapt&#299; in a state of wretchedness, and went off towards
the Deccan. In this confusion many of the royal servants and his own
attendants willingly or unwillingly separated, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>did
not accompany him. As the native country of J&#257;do R&#257;y and
&#362;day R&#257;m and &#256;tas&#863;h K. was on the route, they
thought it better for themselves to keep with him for some stages, but
J&#257;do R&#257;y did not come into his camp, and followed him at the
distance of one stage. He took possession of such property as the men
in this confusion and fear for their lives abandoned. On the day he
(S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n) started from the other side of the river
(the Tapt&#299;) he sent a message by one of his immediate attendants
of the name of Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r K. Turkm&#257;n, summoning
Sar-buland K. Afghan, with the message that it seemed to him contrary
to courage and the due performance of his engagements that he had as
yet not crossed the river. &ldquo;Fidelity was the glory of men; the
faithlessness of no one has touched me (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n) so
much as yours.&rdquo; He (Sar-buland) was standing on horseback on the
river-bank when Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8152src" href="#xd24e8152" name="xd24e8152src">40</a> K. came and
delivered the message. Sar-buland did not give a precise answer, and
was undecided as to whether to stay or go. In his perplexity and by way
of objection he told Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r to let go his bridle.
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r drew his sword, and struck at his waist. At
this crisis an Afghan interposed a short spear which the people of
India call a <i>barchh&#257;</i>, and the blow of the sword caught the
shaft, and the point of the sword did not reach Sar-buland&rsquo;s
waist. After swords were drawn, the Afghans attacked
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r and cut him in pieces. The son of
Sult&#804;&#257;n Muh&#803;ammad, the treasurer, who was
B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s page, for friendship&rsquo;s sake had come (with
Z&#817;&#363;-l-faq&#257;r) without B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s permission,
and was also killed.</p>
<p class="par">Briefly, when the news of his leaving Burhanpur and of
the victorious army&rsquo;s approaching that city reached me, I sent
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K. on the wings of haste to my loyal
son, and strongly impressed upon him that he must not relax his
efforts, but must determine either to take him alive or to drive him
out of the imperial territory. It was said that if things went badly
with him on this side, it was probable that he would throw himself by
the road of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk&rsquo;s country into the provinces of
Orissa and Bengal. This, too, was in accordance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>with
military plans. So out of caution, which is becoming to a ruler, I
appointed M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam to be governor of Allahabad and
dismissed him with orders that if such circumstances should so occur
(as S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n&rsquo;s going to Bengal), he should
rectify matters.</p>
<p class="par">At this time my son (<i>farzand</i>) K&#863;h&#257;n
Jah&#257;n came from Multan, and had the good fortune to pay his
respects. By way of nazar he presented 1,000 muhrs and a ruby of the
value of Rs. 100,000, a pearl, and other jewels. I gave an elephant to
Rustam K. On the 9th of the Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n
K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779; K. brought a report from the prince and
Mah&#257;bat K. to the effect that when my son (Parw&#299;z) reached
Burhanpur, though many of his men had remained behind in consequence of
the heavy rains, he, according to orders, without delay had crossed the
river (Tapt&#299;), and gone in pursuit of B&#299;-daulat.
B&#299;-daulat, on hearing this terrible news, was marching on. On
account of the heaviness of the rain and the excessive quantity of mud
and constant marching his beasts of burden had become exhausted. If any
baggage was left behind no inquiries were made, and he (S&#863;h&#257;h
Jah&#257;n) and his children and dependents thought themselves lucky to
save their lives and did not trouble about their goods. The army of
good fortune having come down the pass of Bhangar, hastened after him
as far as the pargana of Ankot,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8167src"
href="#xd24e8167" name="xd24e8167src">41</a> about forty koss from
Burhanpur. B&#299;-daulat in this state reached the fort of
M&#257;h&#363;r, and when he knew that J&#257;do R&#257;y and &#362;day
R&#257;m and the other Dakhanis would not go with him any farther, he
did not disgrace them, but let them go. Leaving the heavy elephants
with the goods and chattels with &#362;day R&#257;m in the fort, he
himself started for Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk&rsquo;s territory. When his
departure from the royal territory was ascertained, my fortunate son,
with the approval of Mah&#257;bat K. and other loyalists, turned rein
from that pargana. On the first of the Divine month of &#256;b&#257;n
he entered Burhanpur. R&#257;ja S&#257;rang Deo was sent to my son with
a gracious farman.</p>
<p class="par">Q&#257;sim K. was raised to the mansab of 4,000 personal
and 2,000 horse. M&#299;rak Mu&#703;&#299;n, Bakhshi of Kabul, at the
request <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>of Mah&#257;bat K., was honoured with the title
of K&#863;h&#257;n. Alf K. Qiy&#257;m-k&#863;h&#257;n&#299;, having
come from the Subah of Patna, paid his respects, and was appointed to
the charge of the fort of K&#257;ng&#7771;a. I presented him with a
standard. On the 1st of the Divine month of &#256;z&#817;ar
B&#257;q&#299; K. came from J&#363;n&#257;ga&#7771;h and waited on
me.</p>
<p class="par">As I was at ease with regard to the affair of
B&#299;-daulat, and the heat of Hindustan did not agree with my
constitution, on the 2nd of the month, corresponding with the 1st of
&#7778;afar<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8176src" href="#xd24e8176" name=
"xd24e8176src">42</a> my camp started from Ajmir for a tour and to hunt
in the pleasant regions of Kashmir. Before this I had appointed the
chief of the state &#256;&#7779;af K. Subahdar of Bengal, and gave him
leave. As I had taken a great liking to his society, and he was
distinguished above all the other servants for ability and good
disposition and tact, and is moreover unequalled in all kinds of
propriety, and I regretted separation from him, I had broken through
that purpose, and had sent for him to wait upon me. He came on this
day, and had the good fortune to kiss the threshold. Jagat Singh, s.
R&#257;n&#257; Karan, took leave on his return to his native country,
and was given a dress of honour and a jewelled dagger. R&#257;ja
S&#257;rang Deo brought a report from my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h
Parw&#299;z and Mah&#257;bat K. Mad&#257;ru-s-salt&#804;ana, and kissed
the threshold. It was written that their minds were at ease with regard
to the affair of B&#299;-daulat, and that the rulers of the Deccan,
willingly or unwillingly, were performing the dues of obedience and
submission. His Majesty (Jah&#257;ng&#299;r) might make his mind at
ease about that quarter and enjoy himself in hunting and travelling in
whatever place in the royal dominions he might approve of and which was
good for his health. On the 20th of the month M&#299;rz&#257;
W&#257;l&#299;, having come from Sironj, waited on me. H&#803;ak&#299;m
M&#363;min&#257; was raised to the mansab of 1,000. A&#7779;&#257;lat
K., s. K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n, according to order, came from
Gujarat, and had the good fortune to pay his respects.</p>
<p class="par">At this time a report came from &#703;Aq&#299;dat K.,
Bakhshi of the Deccan, containing the news of R&#257;ja Girdhar&rsquo;s
having been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>killed. The particulars of this event are that
one of the brothers of Sayyid Kab&#299;r B&#257;rha, who was an
attendant of my fortunate son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, gave his
sword to brighten and put on the wheel (to sharpen) to a cutler who had
a shop close to the house of R&#257;ja Girdhar. The next day, when he
came to fetch his sword, a conversation took place as to the charge for
the work, and the people of the Sayyid struck the cutler some blows
with a stick. The Raja&rsquo;s people in supporting him used their
whips on them. By chance two or three young Sayyids of B&#257;rha had
lodgings in that neighbourhood, and hearing of this disturbance, went
to the assistance of the aforesaid Sayyid. The fire of strife was
lighted, and a fight took place between the Sayyids and Rajputs, ending
in an encounter with arrows and swords. Sayyid Kab&#299;r, becoming
aware of this, came to assist with thirty or forty horsemen, and at
this time R&#257;ja Girdhar, with a body of Rajputs and his caste
people, according to the custom of the Hindus, were sitting barebodied
and eating their food. Becoming aware of the coming of Sayyid
Kab&#299;r and the violence of the Sayyids, he brought his men inside
the house and firmly closed the door. The Sayyids, setting fire to the
door, forced their way inside and the fight went to such a length that
R&#257;ja Girdhar and twenty-six of his servants were killed and forty
others wounded. Four of the Sayyids were also killed. After R&#257;ja
Girdhar was killed, Sayyid Kab&#299;r took the horses out of his stable
to his own house and returned. The Rajput officers, when informed of
the slaying of R&#257;ja Girdhar, came on horseback in great numbers
from their houses, and all the B&#257;rha Sayyids came to the aid of
Sayyid Kab&#299;r. They assembled in the plain outside the citadel, and
the fire of trouble and calamity increased, and it nearly came to a
great disturbance. Mah&#257;bat K., being informed of it, immediately
mounted and went there, and bringing the Sayyids into the citadel, and
soothing the Rajputs in a manner suitable to the occasion, took some of
their chief men with him and went to the house of K&#863;h&#257;n
&#703;&#256;lam, which was near there. He soothed them down in a proper
way, and promised and became security for an inquiry into the matter.
When this news reached the prince <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284"
href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>he also went to the quarters
of the K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam, and soothed them with words
appropriate to the state of affairs, and sent the Rajputs to their own
houses. Next day Mah&#257;bat K. went to the house of R&#257;ja
Girdhar, condoled and sympathized with his sons, and having contrived
to get hold of Sayyid Kab&#299;r put him into confinement. As the
Rajputs would not be consoled without his being put to death, after a
few days he executed him.</p>
<p class="par">On the 23rd I appointed Muh&#803;ammad Mur&#257;d
faujd&#257;r of Ajmir, and sent him off. On this road I continually
enjoyed myself in sporting. One day, while hunting, a
<i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i> (albino) partridge, which till now I had
never seen, came to my sight, and I caught it with a hawk. By chance
the hawk that caught it was also a <i>t&#363;yg&#863;h&#363;n</i>. I
ascertained by trial that the flesh of the black partridge was better
than that of the white, and that the flesh of the large quail
(<i>b&#363;dana</i>), which the people of India call
<i>gh&#257;ghar</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8199src" href=
"#xd24e8199" name="xd24e8199src">43</a> is better than that of the
quail, which is a fighter. I compared the flesh of a fat kid with that
of a lamb; the flesh of the fat kid is more delicious. By way of test I
ordered them both to be cooked in the same way, so that I might discern
the matter accurately. On this account I have recorded it.</p>
<p class="par">On the 10th of the month of Dai, in the neighbourhood of
the pargana of Rah&#803;&#299;m&#257;b&#257;d,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8207src" href="#xd24e8207" name="xd24e8207src">44</a> the
huntsmen brought in news of a tiger. I ordered Ir&#257;dat K. and
Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. to take with them some of the guards
(<i>ahl-i-y&#257;tis&#863;h</i>) and surround the wood, and mounting
(an elephant) I followed them and went towards the hunt. From the
number of trees and thickness of the jungle it could not be well seen.
Driving the elephant forward, the tiger&rsquo;s flank came into view,
and with one wound from my gun he fell and gave up his life. Of all the
tigers I have shot from the time when I was a prince until now I never
saw a tiger like this for size and majesty and the symmetry of its
limbs. I ordered the artists to take its portrait according to its real
form and body. He weighed 8&frac12; Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&#299; maunds;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=

<p class="par">On the 16th it was reported that Mumt&#257;z<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8234src" href="#xd24e8234" name=
"xd24e8234src">46</a> K., the governor of Agra, had died. At first he
was in the service of Bah&#257;dur K., the brother of K&#863;h&#257;n
Zam&#257;n. After they were killed he entered the service of my revered
father. When I placed my foot in the world of existence that revered
person favoured me with making him the N&#257;z&#804;ir
(Superintendent) of my establishment. For a period of fifty-six years
he served me sincerely and zealously and in a manner to please me, and
at no time did a speck of dust from him settle on the fringe of my
heart. What is due to him for the excellence of his service is more
than a clerk could write. May God Almighty overwhelm him in the ocean
of His forgiveness!</p>
<p class="par">Having conferred on Muqarrab K., who is one of the old
officials,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8239src" href="#xd24e8239" name=
"xd24e8239src">47</a> the government and administration of Agra, I gave
him his leave. In the neighbourhood of Fath&#803;p&#363;r, Mukarram K.
and his brother &#703;Abdu-s-Sal&#257;m had the good fortune to pay
their respects. On the 22nd the entertainment for my lunar weighment
took place in the town of Mathura, and the fifty-seventh year of my age
began auspiciously and happily. At Mathura I went on by boat seeing
what was to be seen, and hunting. On the way the huntsmen reported that
a tigress with three cubs had appeared. Disembarking from the boat I
engaged in the pleasure of sport. As the cubs were small I ordered them
to be taken by hand, and killed the mother with my gun. At this time it
was reported to me that the villagers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8247src" href="#xd24e8247" name="xd24e8247src">48</a> and
cultivators on the other side of the river Jumna had not given up
stealing and highway robbery, and, passing their time in the shelter of
thick jungles and difficult strong places in stubbornness and
fearlessness, would not pay their rents to the jagirdars. I gave an
order to K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n to take a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>force of mansabdars with him and give them
exemplary punishment, and having slaughtered, imprisoned, and plundered
them, raze to the ground their strongholds and forts, and tear up from
the root their thorn-brakes of mischief and disturbance. The next day
the force crossed the river and made a hot attack on them. As they had
no time for escape by flight they planted firmly the foot of folly, and
showed fight. Many of them were slaughtered: their women and children
were taken prisoners, and much booty fell into the hands of the
victorious army.</p>
<p class="par">On 1st Bahman, having promoted Rustam K. to the
faujd&#257;rship of the Sarkar of Qanauj, I sent him there.</p>
<p class="par">On the 2nd &#703;Abdu-llah, s. H&#803;ak&#299;m
N&#363;ru-d-d&#299;n, of Teheran, was ordered to be capitally punished
in my presence. The explanation of this brief announcement is as
follows: When the ruler of Persia, on suspicion of his having money and
other property, tortured his father, the aforesaid fled from Persia,
and with a hundred miseries and adversities threw himself into
Hindustan, and by the patronage of I&#703;tim&#257;du-d-daula was
enrolled among the servants of the Court. By the aid of good fortune,
having in a short time become well known, he was included among those
who were in immediate attendance, and obtained a mansab of 500 and a
fertile jagir, but as his capacity was small (lit., his digestion was
narrow) he could not stand such great good fortune, and assumed
ingratitude and unthankfulness and constantly defiled his tongue with
abuse<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8258src" href="#xd24e8258" name=
"xd24e8258src">49</a> of his lord and master. At this time it was
continually reported to me that as my kindness to him and observance of
what was due to him increased, that ungrateful one blamed and abused me
the more. When I considered the favours I had bestowed upon him, I
could not believe these stories about him, but at last I heard from
impartial and disinterested persons the disrespectful language which he
had used with respect to me in assemblies and companies. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>The
charge was thus confirmed, and accordingly I summoned him to my
presence and had him executed.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8275src"
href="#xd24e8275" name="xd24e8275src">50</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A red<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8282src" href=
"#xd24e8282" name="xd24e8282src">51</a> tongue gives the green head to
the winds.&rdquo; As the huntsmen reported that there was a tigress in
this neighbourhood, by the mischief caused by which the inhabitants
were oppressed, I ordered Fid&#257;&#702;&#299; K. to take elephants
with him and surround it. Mounting myself, I followed him into the
forest. It soon came to view, and with one shot from my gun its affairs
were finished. One day I was enjoying myself with sport, and caught a
black partridge with a hawk. I ordered them to open its crop in my
presence. A mouse it had swallowed whole came out of its crop, and
which was not yet digested. I was greatly astonished that the pipe of
its gullet, small as it was, should swallow a whole mouse and how it
had done so. Without exaggeration, if anyone had told me the tale I
should not have believed it. As I saw this myself I have recorded it on
account of its strangeness. On the 6th of the month Delhi became the
abode of good fortune.</p>
<p class="par">As Jagat Singh, s. R&#257;ja B&#257;so, at the
instigation of B&#299;-daulat, had gone out into the hills in the north
of the Panjab, which <span class="corr" id="xd24e8287" title=
"Source: are">is</span> his hereditary abode, and raised a disturbance
there, I appointed &#7778;&#257;diq K. to punish him, as has been
related in the preceding pages. At this time M&#257;dho Singh, his
younger brother, was promoted to the title of Raja, and given a horse
and robe of honour. An order was given for him to go to
&#7778;&#257;diq K. and attack the rebels with him.</p>
<p class="par">Next day I marched from the outskirts of the city, and
alighted at Sal&#299;mga&#7771;h. As the house of R&#257;ja
Kis&#863;han D&#257;s was on the road, and he had made great efforts
and entreated me to do so, I at his request threw the shadow of
prosperity on his dwelling, and gratified the desire of that old
servant. A few of his offerings were accepted in order to dignify him.
Marching on the 20th from Sal&#299;mga&#7771;h, I appointed Sayyid
Bahwa Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#299; to the governorship of Delhi, which is
his ordinary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>residence. In fact, he had already done this
service well, and I had given him high rank.</p>
<p class="par">At this time &#703;Al&#299; Muh&#803;ammad, s.
&#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8296src" href=
"#xd24e8296" name="xd24e8296src">52</a> ruler of Tibet, by his
father&rsquo;s order came to Court, and had the good fortune to pay his
respects. It was clear that &#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y had a great
affection for and attachment to this son, and held him dearer than his
other children. He wished to make him his successor, and he was
consequently envied by his brothers, and disputes arose between them.
Abd&#257;l, s. &#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y, who was the eldest of his
children, through this jealousy sought the patronage of the
K&#863;h&#257;n of Kashghar and made him his protector, so that when
&#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y, who was very old and decrepit, should die, he
might, under the protection of the W&#257;l&#299; of Kashghar, become
ruler of Tibet. &#703;Al&#299; R&#257;y, suspecting that the brothers
might attack &#703;Al&#299; Muh&#803;ammad, and a disturbance might
arise in his country, sent him to Court, his desire being that he might
be attached to this Court, and his affairs might prosper by service to
and kindness shown by the Court.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st of the Il&#257;h&#299; month of
Isfand&#257;rmuz&#817; I pitched in the pargana of Umbala.
Las&#863;hkar&#299;, s. Im&#257;m-wird&#299;, who had run away from
B&#299;-daulat, and joined the service of my auspicious son
S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z, having come on this date to Court, kissed
the threshold. A report came from my son and Mah&#257;bat K. It
contained the recommendation and the offer of service of
&#703;&#256;dil K., with a letter which he had sent to Mah&#257;bat, in
which were set forth his submissiveness and loyalty.
Las&#863;hkar&#299; was sent back to Parw&#299;z with a dress of
honour, a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> with pearl buttons for the prince,
and a dress of honour for K&#863;h&#257;n &#703;&#256;lam and
Mah&#257;bat K. At the request of my son I wrote a gracious farman to
&#703;&#256;dil K. showing great favour to him, and sent him a robe of
honour with a special <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i>. I gave an order that if
they thought fit they should send the above-mentioned<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8310src" href="#xd24e8310" name="xd24e8310src">53</a> to
&#703;&#256;dil K.</p>
<p class="par">On the 5th I alighted at the garden of Sihrind. On the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>bank of the Beas &#7778;&#257;diq K.,
Muk&#863;ht&#257;r K., Isfandiy&#257;r, R&#257;ja R&#363;p Chand of
Gwalior, and other Amirs who had been appointed to support him, having
succeeded in restoring order in the northern hill-country, had the good
fortune to kiss the threshold. The facts, briefly, are that Jagat
Singh, at the instigation of B&#299;-daulat, had taken to the hills
above-mentioned, and engaged in stirring up sedition and strife. As the
field was clear (<i>i.e.</i>, there was no one to oppose him) he passed
over difficult mountains and defiles, and by attacking and plundering
peasantry and the weak, heaped misfortune on them until
&#7778;&#257;diq K. arrived. He brought the Zamindars under control by
means of fears and hopes, and made the overthrow of that wretched
creature the object of his exertions. Jagat Singh strengthened the fort
of Mau, and was protected by it. Whenever he found an opportunity he
left that fortress and fought with the royal servants. At last his
provisions were exhausted, and he came to despair of assistance from
the other Zamindars. The elevation of his younger brother became a
source of disturbance and anxiety to him. Helplessly he then sought for
patronage, and begged the protection of N&#363;r Jah&#257;n Begam,
expressing shame and contrition, and sought a refuge in her mediation.
In order to please and satisfy her, the pen of pardon was drawn through
the record of his faults.</p>
<p class="par">On this day reports came in from the officials in the
Deccan that B&#299;-daulat, with La&#703;natu-llah, D&#257;r&#257;b,
and other wretched (with broken wing and feathers) creatures in
miserable condition, with blackened faces, had gone from the borders of
Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk&rsquo;s territory towards Orissa and Bengal. In this
journey great loss fell on him and his companions, many of whom, when a
chance offered, with bare heads and feet, and having washed their hands
of life (desperate), took to flight. Out of these one day
M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad, s. Afz&#803;al K., his Diwan, with his
mother and his family, ran away during the march, and when the news
reached B&#299;-daulat, he sent Ja&#703;far and
K&#863;h&#257;n-qul&#299; Uzbeg and some others of his confidential men
in pursuit of him, that, if they could take him alive, well and good,
or otherwise they should cut off his head and bring it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>into
his presence. They with all speed proceeded and caught him up on the
road. Becoming aware of this, he sent his mother and family into the
jungles and hid them there, and himself with a body of young men whom
he relied on as companions, planted manfully the foot of courage and
stood with their bows. In front of them there was a canal and a swamp
(<i>chihl&#257;</i>). Sayyid Ja&#703;far K. wished to approach near him
and take him with him by deceiving him, but however much he tried to
persuade him by threatening and holding out hopes, it had no effect,
and he answered him with life-taking arrows. He made a good fight of
it, and sent K&#863;h&#257;n-qul&#299; and some others of
B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s men to hell. Sayyid Ja&#703;far also was
wounded. Finally M&#299;rz&#257; Muh&#803;ammad received severe wounds
and gambled away the cash of his life. But as long as he had breath he
deprived many thereof. After he was killed, they cut off his head and
took it to B&#299;-daulat.</p>
<p class="par">When B&#299;-daulat was defeated near Delhi and went to
M&#257;nd&#363;, he sent Afz&#803;al K. to get assistance and support
from &#703;&#256;dil K. and others, forwarding with him an armlet
(<i>b&#257;z&#363;-band</i>) for &#703;&#256;dil K., and a horse, an
elephant, and a jewelled sword for &#703;Ambar. He first went to
&#703;Ambar. After delivering his message he produced what
B&#299;-daulat had sent for him, but &#703;Ambar would not accept them,
saying he was the servant of &#703;&#256;dil K., who was at present the
head of those in power in the Deccan: he should go first to him and
explain what he desired. If he agreed, his slave would ally himself to
and obey him, and in that case he would take whatever was sent,
otherwise not. Afz&#803;al K. went to &#703;&#256;dil K., who received
him very badly, and for a long time kept him outside the city and did
not look into his affair, but put all kinds of slights upon him, but
secretly asked for what B&#299;-daulat had sent for him and
&#703;Ambar, and took possession of it. The aforesaid (Afz&#803;al K.)
was there when he heard the news of the killing of his son and the ruin
of his family, and so fell upon evil days. In short, B&#299;-daulat, in
spite of all his (original) good fortune and happy auspices, undertook
a long and distant journey, and came to the port of Machhl&#299;
Pa&#7789;an (Masulipa&#7789;am), which belongs to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. Before reaching this place,
he sent some of his men to Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, and besought him for all
sorts of assistance and companionship. Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk sent him a
small amount of cash and goods for his support, and wrote to the warden
of his frontier to conduct him in safety out of his territory, and
encourage the grain-sellers and Zamindars to send grain and all other
necessaries to his camp.</p>
<p class="par">On the 27th of the month a strange event took place.
Returning from the hunting-place, I had come back to the camp at night.
By chance I crossed a stream of water, the bed of which was very rocky
and the water running violently. One of the servants of the
<i>s&#863;harbat-k&#863;h&#257;na</i> (wine-cellar) was conveying a
huntsman&rsquo;s relish. He had a gold tray, which contained a salver
and five cups. There were covers to the cups, and the whole was in a
cotton bag. When he was crossing, his foot slipped and the tray fell
out of his hand. As the water was deep and running rapidly, however
much they searched and beat their hands and feet (exerted themselves),
no trace of it could be found. Next day the state of the case was
reported to me, and I ordered a number of boatmen and huntsmen to go to
the place and make a careful search, and it perhaps might appear. By
chance, in the place where it had fallen it was found, and more strange
still, it had not been turned upside down, and not a drop of water had
got into the cups. This affair is similar to what happened when
H&#257;d&#299; was seated on the throne of the Khalifate. A ruby ring
had been inherited by H&#257;r&#363;n from his father. H&#257;d&#299;
sent a slave to H&#257;r&#363;n and asked for it. It happened that at
that time H&#257;r&#363;n was seated on the bank of the Tigris. The
slave gave the message, and H&#257;r&#363;n, enraged, said: &ldquo;I
have allowed thee<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8339src" href="#xd24e8339"
name="xd24e8339src">54</a> to have the Khalifate, and thou dost not
allow me one ring.&rdquo; In his rage he threw the ring into the
Tigris. After some months by the decree of fate H&#257;d&#299; died,
and the turn of the Khalifate came to H&#257;r&#363;n. He ordered
divers to look for the ring in the place where he had thrown it. By the
chances of destiny, and the aid of good fortune, at the first dive the
ring was found, and brought and given into H&#257;r&#363;n&rsquo;s
hand! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At this time one day on the hunting ground the chief
huntsman Im&#257;m-wird&#299; brought before me a partridge that had a
spur on one leg and not on the other. As the way to distinguish the
female lies in the spur, by way of testing me he asked whether this was
a male or a female. I said at once &ldquo;A female.&rdquo; When they
opened it an egg appeared inside (<i>p&#299;s&#863;h&#299;na</i>) its
belly. The people who were in attendance asked with surprise by what
sign I had discovered this: I said that the head and beak of the female
are shorter than the male&rsquo;s. By investigation and often seeing
(the birds) I had acquired this dexterity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8348src" href="#xd24e8348" name="xd24e8348src">55</a> It is a
strange thing that the windpipe in all animals
(<i>h&#803;aiw&#257;n&#257;t</i>), which the Turks call
<i>h&#803;alq</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8372src" href=
"#xd24e8372" name="xd24e8372src">56</a> is single from the top of the
throat to the crop (<i>ch&#299;na-d&#257;n</i>), while in the case of
the bustard (<i>jarz</i>) it is different. In the bustard it is for
four finger-breadths from the top of the throat single and then it
divides into two branches and in this form reaches the crop. Also at
the place where it divides into two branches there is a stoppage
(<i>sar-band</i>) and a knot (<i>girih</i>) is felt by the hand. In the
<i>kulang</i> (crane) it is still stranger. In it the windpipe passes
in a serpentine manner between the bones of the breast to the rump and
then turns back from there and joins the throat. The <i>jarz</i> or
<i>charz</i> (bustard) is of two kinds: one is a mottled black and the
other <i>b&#363;r</i> (a kind of dun colour). I now<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8410src" href="#xd24e8410" name="xd24e8410src">57</a>
discovered that there are not two kinds, but that which is a mottled
black is the male, and that which is dun-coloured is the female. The
proof of it is this, that in the piebald there are testicles and in the
dun one there are eggs; this has been repeatedly found on
examination.</p>
<p class="par">I have a great liking for fish, and all kinds of good
fish are brought for me; the best fish in Hindustan is the
<i>roh&#363;</i>, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=

distinguish between them. The difference in their flesh also is very
small, but the connoisseur discovers that the flesh of the

K&#863;hw&#257;ja Ab&#363;-l-H&#803;asan, received as original and
increase that of 1,000 and 300 horse. Muh&#803;ammad Sa&#703;&#299;d,
s. Ah&#803;mad Beg K. K&#257;bul&#299;, the same, M&#299;r S&#863;haraf
D&#299;w&#257;n-i-buy&#363;t&#257;t, and K&#863;haw&#257;&#7779;&#7779;
K., each of them that of 1,000. Sard&#257;r K., having come from
K&#257;ng&#7771;a, had the good fortune to pay his respects. At this
time I gave orders to the <i>yas&#257;wuls</i> and men of the
<i>yas&#257;q</i> (guards) that hereafter at the time when I came out
of the palace they should keep away defective people, such as the
blind, and those whose noses and ears had been cut off, the leprous and
the maimed, and all kinds of sick people, and not permit them to be
seen. On the 19th the feast of the culmination was held.
Il&#257;h-wird&#299;, the brother of Im&#257;m-wird&#299;, had run away
from B&#299;-daulat and came to Court, and was honoured with great
favours.</p>
<p class="par">As the news of B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s coming to the
border of Orissa was constantly repeated, a farman was issued to the
prince and Mah&#257;bat K. and the Amirs who had been sent to the
support of my son, that they should set their minds at ease about the
administering the provinces (of the Deccan), and go quickly to
Allahabad and Behar, and if the Subahdar of Bengal could not forestall
him, and he should put forward the foot of audacity, he must be made a
wanderer in the desert <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>of disappointment by the blows of
the victorious army which is in the shadow of the flag of my son. By
way of precaution on the 2nd Urd&#299;bihis&#863;ht I gave my son
K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n leave to proceed to Agra to remain in that
neighbourhood and wait for a sign. If there should happen to be any
necessity for a particular service and an order should be given him, he
must act as occasion might require. I sent him a special dress of
honour, with a <i>n&#257;dir&#299;</i> with pearl buttons, a special
jewelled sword, and to A&#7779;&#257;lat K., his son, a horse, and a
dress of honour.</p>
<p class="par">On this day a report came from &#703;Aq&#299;dat K.,
Bakhshi of the Deccan. He wrote that, according to order, my prosperous
son S&#863;h&#257;h Parw&#299;z had married the sister of R&#257;ja Gaj
Singh. I hope that her coming will be auspicious to the State. He also
wrote that, having sent for Turkum&#257;n K. from Pattan he had
appointed &#703;Az&#299;zu-llah in his place. J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K.,
also by order, came and waited on me. When B&#299;-daulat crossed the
Burhanpur river and took the road of ruin, M&#299;r
H&#803;us&#257;mu-d-d&#299;n, considering his own evil deeds, could not
remain at Burhanpur. Taking his children with him, he conveyed the
goods of ruin to the Deccan, in order that he might pass his days under
the protection of &#703;&#256;dil K. By chance, as he passed by
B&#299;r, J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K. obtained information, and sent a body
of men to head him off. He seized him and his dependants, and brought
them before Mah&#257;bat. Mah&#257;bat placed him in confinement, and
took from him Rs. 1,00,000 in cash and goods. (Also) J&#257;do R&#257;y
and &#362;day R&#257;m had taken the elephants which B&#299;-daulat had
left in Burhanpur and brought them to the prince (Parw&#299;z).</p>
<p class="par">Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z, who
had come to Delhi from B&#299;-daulat in order to state his objects,
had not been allowed by me an opportunity to speak and I had handed him
over to Mah&#257;bat K. After his (B&#299;-daulat&rsquo;s) defeat and
ruin Mah&#257;bat K. had made him his own servant. As he was an old
friend of &#703;&#256;dil K., and was for some years at
B&#299;j&#257;p&#363;r as Vakil of K&#863;h&#257;n Jah&#257;n.
Mah&#257;bat K. now sent him again as his representative<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8469src" href="#xd24e8469" name="xd24e8469src">1</a>
to &#703;&#256;dil K&#863;h&#257;n, and the leading men of the Deccan,
<i lang="la">nolentes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href=
"#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>volentes</i>, looking to the
necessities of the time and the upshot of affairs, were contented and
professed loyalty and desire for service. The rebel &#703;Ambar sent
one of his confidential men of the name of &#703;Al&#299;
S&#863;h&#299;r, and displayed great humility. He (&#703;Ambar) wrote
in the capacity of a servant to Mah&#257;bat K., and engaged that he
(&#703;Ambar) should come to Dewalg&#257;on<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8478src" href="#xd24e8478" name="xd24e8478src">2</a> and wait
upon Mah&#257;bat. He would make his eldest son a servant of the State,
and keep him in the service of my auspicious son. About this time there
arrived a letter from Q&#257;z&#803;&#299; &#703;Abdu-l-&#703;Az&#299;z
that &#703;&#256;dil K. from the bottom of his heart had elected for
service and loyalty, and agreed that he would send Mull&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad L&#257;r&#299;, who was his principal agent and
minister, and whom both in spoken and written messages he called
Mull&#257; B&#257;b&#257;, with 5,000 horse, that he might remain
continually on duty, and they might know that other<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8481src" href="#xd24e8481" name="xd24e8481src">3</a> troops
would follow (?). Urgent farmans had been sent that my son should
proceed to Allahabad and Behar in order to overthrow B&#299;-daulat. At
this time news arrived that notwithstanding the rainy season and the
violence of the rain, that son, on the 6th Farward&#299;n had marched
out of Burhanpur with the army of fortune, and had taken up his
quarters in L&#257;l B&#257;g&#863;h,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8484src" href="#xd24e8484" name="xd24e8484src">4</a> and that
Mah&#257;bat K. was awaiting at Burhanpur the arrival of Mull&#257;
Muh&#803;ammad L&#257;r&#299;, so that when he arrived he would relieve
himself of the care of the maintenance of order in that neighbourhood,
and come with him (Muh&#803;ammad L&#257;r&#299;) to wait on my son.
Las&#863;hkar K., J&#257;do R&#257;y, &#362;day R&#257;m, and other
servants of the State had been ordered to go to the
B&#257;l&#257;g&#863;h&#257;t (the country above the Ghats), and remain
at Z&#804;afarnagar. Having given J&#257;n-sip&#257;r K. leave as
before, he (Parw&#299;z) kept Asad K. Ma&#703;m&#363;r&#299; at
Elichpur. Min&#363;chihr, s. S&#863;h&#257;h-naw&#257;z K., was
appointed to J&#257;ln&#257;p&#363;r. He sent Riz&#803;aw&#299; K. to
Th&#257;lner, to guard the province of Khandesh.</p>
<p class="par">On this day news came that Las&#863;hkar&#299; had taken
the farman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>to &#703;&#256;dil K., and he, having decorated
the city, had gone out four koss to meet him, and had performed
salutations and prostrations for the farman and the dress of honour. On
the 21st I sent dresses of honour for my son
D&#257;war-bak&#863;hs&#863;h and K&#863;h&#257;n A&#703;z&#804;am and
&#7778;af&#299; K. Having appointed &#7778;&#257;diq K. to the
government of Lahore, and given him a dress of honour and an elephant,
I gave him leave. An order was given that he should have the mansab of
400 personal and 400 horse. Multafat K., s. M&#299;rz&#257; Rustam,
raised the head of distinction with the mansab of 1,500 personal and
300 horse.</p>
<p class="par">One day while hunting it was reported to me that a snake
with a black hood (<i>kafcha</i>) had swallowed another hooded
(<i>kafcha?</i>) snake and gone into a hole. I ordered them to dig up
the place and bring out the snake. Without exaggeration I had never
seen a snake of this size. When, they opened its belly, the hood of the
snake that it had swallowed came out whole. Although this snake was of
another kind, in length and girth little difference was visible.</p>
<p class="par">At this time it was represented to me in a
report<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8501src" href="#xd24e8501" name=
"xd24e8501src">5</a> by the news writer of the Deccan that Mah&#257;bat
K. had ordered &#703;&#256;rif s. Z&#257;hid to be executed, and had
put him (<i>i.e.</i>, Z&#257;hid), with two other sons, in prison. It
appeared that that wretched man had written with his own hand a
petition to B&#299;-daulat representing on the part of his father and
himself his loyalty, sincerity, repentance, and shame. By fate that
letter fell into the hands of Mah&#257;bat K. Having sent for
&#703;&#256;rif into his presence he showed him the letter. As he had
written a decree for his own blood, he could not make any acceptable
excuse, and of necessity he was executed, and his father and brothers
imprisoned.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st K&#863;hurd&#257;d it was reported that
S&#863;haj&#257;&#703;at K. &#703;Arab, had died a natural death in the
Deccan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At this time a report came from Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K.
Fath&#803;-jang that B&#299;-daulat had entered Orissa. The particulars
of this are that between the boundary<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8512src" href="#xd24e8512" name="xd24e8512src">6</a> of Orissa
and the Deccan there is a barrier. On one side there are lofty
mountains, and on the other swamps and a river. The ruler of Golconda
had also erected a wall (<i>dar-band</i>) and a fort, and armed it with
muskets and cannon. The passage of men by that closed route was
impracticable without the leave of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk. B&#299;-daulat,
with the guidance of Qut&#804;bu-l-mulk, having passed by that route,
entered the country of Orissa. It happened that at this time
Ah&#803;mad Beg K., nephew of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K., had attacked the
Zamindars of Khurda. At this strange occurrence, which happened without
precedent or news or information, he became confused and bewildered and
without seeing a remedy gave up his campaign, and came to the village
of Bulbul&#299;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8518src" href="#xd24e8518"
name="xd24e8518src">7</a> (P&#299;pl&#299;), the seat of the governor
of that Subah (Orissa). He then took his women with him and hastened to
Cuttack, which is 12 koss from P&#299;pl&#299; towards Bengal. As the
time was short, he had not leisure to collect troops and arrange his
affairs. He did not feel himself equal to a war with B&#299;-daulat,
and he had not with him associates such as were necessary, so he went
on from Cuttack to Bardwan, of which &#7778;&#257;lih&#803;, nephew of
&#256;&#7779;af K. deceased, was the Jagirdar. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>At
first &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; was astonished<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e8525src" href="#xd24e8525" name="xd24e8525src">8</a>, and did not
believe that B&#299;-daulat was coming, until a letter came from
La&#703;natu-llah to conciliate him. &#7778;&#257;lih&#803; fortified
Bardwan and remained in it. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m K. was surprised on
hearing the terrible news. Though most of his auxiliaries and soldiers
were scattered in the villages round about and unprocurable, he yet
planted the foot of courage firmly in Akbarnagar (Rajmahal), and set
himself to strengthen the fort and collect troops, and encourage the
heads of tribes and retainers. He prepared the things necessary for his
guns and other weapons and for battle. In the meanwhile a notice came
to him from B&#299;-daulat that by the decree of God and the ordinances
of heaven what was not suitable to him had appeared from the womb of
non-existence. By the revolving of crooked-moving time and the changes
of night and day his passage towards these regions had come to pass.
Although to the view of manly courage the extent and breadth of that
country were not more than an exercising-ground, or rather than a
rubbish-heap (<i>pur-k&#257;h&#299;</i>, &ldquo;full of straw&rdquo;),
and his aims were higher, yet as he had to pass by this way, he could
not pass for nothing. If it were Ibr&#257;h&#299;m&rsquo;s
determination to go to the royal Court, he (S&#863;h&#257;h Jah&#257;n)
would hold back the hand of injury from him and his family, and he
might go to Court with an easy mind. If he considered it advisable to
stay, he would bestow upon him any corner of the country he might ask
for.</p>

<h2 class="main">Addendum</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mr. Berthold Laufer&rsquo;s paper on &ldquo;Walrus
and Narwhal Ivory,&rdquo; reprinted at Leyden, 1913, from the <i>Toung
Pao</i>, throws light on Jah&#257;ng&#299;r&rsquo;s remarks about
fish-tooth dagger-hilts. It now seems certain that they were made of
the canine tooth of the walrus, or the horn of the narwhal. Possibly
one reason why Jah&#257;ng&#299;r attached so much value to the
fish-teeth was because they were supposed to be an antidote to poison.
He was fond of such things, and one day, when he was heir-apparent,
Father Jerome Xavier found him engaged at Fath&#803;p&#363;r in
extracting copper from peacocks&rsquo; tails, on account of its
supposed antitoxine properties.</p>
<p class="par">It is stated in Mr. Laufer&rsquo;s paper, pp. 13 and 15,
that walrus-teeth were supposed to be also useful in reducing
swellings. As they were often made into knife-handles, it is not
improbable that the knife which a Rajah of Cochin appears to have sent
to Akbar in 1569 (Akbar-n&#257;ma, i. 342) was, wholly or in part, made
of walrus ivory. The Rajah said that whenever it was applied to a
swelling it reduced it, and Akbar told Ab&#363;-l-Faz&#803;l that over
200 persons had benefited by touching it.</p>
<p class="par">In the British Museum there is a fascinating set of
chessmen made of walrus or narwhal ivory. They were discovered in the
island of Lewis in 1831, but are supposed to be as old as the twelfth
century. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
